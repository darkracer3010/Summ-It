       "' In this video I\\'m going to teach you\\nHTML from very starting to the very end This video is going to be with\\ncomplete own handwritten notes You just have to invest your time in this video\\nthere\\'s no any type of pre-requisite Just invest your time in this video\\nand you\\'ll be able to create beautiful websites Many of you will think that,\\nthis video is quite  lengthy But actually this video is quite short because\\nI\\'ve packed my all experience in this video And I\\'ve provided hand written notes and the source code\\nwhich you can use again & again creating new websites You just have to invest your time in this course and this is\\nabsolutely free, which means you don\\'t have to pay anything You just have to invest your time & attention And teaching you HTML will be my guarantee Before starting this video I want you\\nto hit the like button and comment.... ...Your name and the city you belong to Doing this makes me feel good And if I ever need to interact with you then\\nI can find your comment from my comment box It\\'s been a long time for me coding in HTML And I\\'ll tell you what is important\\nand what\\'s not There are a lot of things which\\npeople usually miss For eg. \"Playing Audio\" \"Main Tag\"\\n\"Semantic Tag\" \"SEO\" There are a lot of thing which people usually miss I\\'m going to cover all these\\ntopics in this video And I\\'ll make you a successful\\n+ profitable HTML developer So that you can get a good starter\\nand you can build good websites Now I want to tell you difference between\\nHTML, CSS & JS with an analogy HTML is like a human skeleton And CSS is just like the\\nskin on the skeleton This means it beautifies that CSS do the same work on HTML\\njust like skin do on our skeleton Our skin provides help to our\\nskeleton to look good And CSS helps the HTML to look beautiful Just like our brain impart the logic in us Just like that JS provides logic to\\nwebsite made with HTML + CSS I\\'ve discuss briefly more about\\nthis in Chapter 0 Where I\\'ve explained this\\nwith another analogy But now we\\'ll understand the difference\\nbetween the Backend & Frontend And how does a basic website works Whenever a web browser request\\n\"www.codewithhary.com\" from a web server So in return web server send the\\nfiles of HTML, CSS and JS Your browser parce these\\nHTML, CSS and JS files And show you what you actually\\nsee in a website Actually it was codes But your browser parce that in such a manner\\nthat a beautiful website is visible to you I\\'ve divided this video in 5 chapters Where I\\'ve provided a practice set with each\\nchapter so that you can practice it well I\\'ve solved important question in that And I\\'ll provide all the code as a zip file In this video I\\'ll tell you how\\nto download those codes Let\\'s get started with the introduction So guys I\\'ve made a PDF of chapter 0 And I\\'ll open this Chapter 0 PDF here And as you can see I\\'ve written\\n\"Chapter 0 introduction\" HTML = Hypertext Markup Language\\nand HTML is the language of the web It is used to create websites If you ever visited a website\\nLet\\'s suppose \"www.codewithharry.com\" If you ever visit a website And then you go to \"View page source\" So you\\'ll be able to see the actual\\nsource of this website You\\'ll be able to see how this website was made What are thing which was used in frontend Which type of tags they have used And now if you don\\'t know about HTML\\nthen maybe you\\'ll find these tags over-whelming But let me tell you, I\\'m going to make\\nthese things very easy for you all So we\\'ve lean about full from of HTML\\nit is Hypertext Markup Language This is the language of the web\\nwhich means you\\'ll need this ...If you want to display\\nbeautiful web pages It is used to create websites We use HTML tags to define\\nlook & feel of a website To define the look & feel of a website\\nwe use the HTML For eg. if I want a link here,\\nso I\\'ll specify that through an HTML tag And if I want an image here, so I\\'ll\\nneed to specify that through an HTML tag That I need an image here And if I need text or a paragraph here\\nso I\\'ve to specify that through an HTML tag That I need a paragraph here Just take page composition like\\na food with different kind of ingredients Like a recipe For eg. in cake if you want to\\nadd chocolate or cake Just like these ingredients you have\\nto add HTML tags in HTML web page Now just like you make food\\nthere\\'s a recipe You add the ingredients accordingly It\\'s not like you added 10 tsp Chilli powder\\nand 20 tsp salt There\\'s a sequence in the recipe\\nwhich we have to follow Just like there\\'s a sequence of using HTML tags You have to add those tags accordingly Now look, HTML stands\\nfor Hypertext Markup Language HTML is the language of the web\\nit is used to create websites We use HTML tags to define\\nlook & feel of the website With understanding of these tags and how to put them\\ntogether, we can create beautiful websites easily We can create a very beautiful website\\nwith understanding these tags If we know how we can use\\nthese tags together So we can make very beautiful websites Just like I made \"codewithhary.com\" I definitely used my HTML\\nknowledge while creating it HTML knowledge will definitely be\\nused while creating any type of website The biggest question people will have in their mind is\\n\"If HTML is enough so why we need CSS & JS? \" Let me tell you HTML is only used to define your\\nwebsite\\'s page\\'s layout I repeat,to define your website\\'s page\\'s layout It is just a bare bone page structure You haven\\'t added any design or style in it If you don\\'t use the CSS,\\nlet me show you how your website will look I\\'ll only keep the HTML and\\nremove the CSS from this So all the CSS style sheets....\\nYou don\\'t have to learn these things I\\'m just showing you after removing the CSS style sheets And look after removing  CSS style sheets\\nthis is how it looks Now you don\\'t have to learn how to remove style sheets Because I\\'m going to teach you this But I just want to show you.... ...If I remove CSS style sheets\\nso this is how it looks So now you all know why CSS is used for? CSS is used for to handle the designs\\nand all other things I haven\\'t ruined this website I just changed that on frontend\\nAnd I\\'ll also teach you this This was not changes on Backend\\nwhich means I haven\\'t changed this for all I only changes \"codewithhary.com\"\\nfor this particular browser Look, I reloaded this page\\nand everything is in its place So this button is of green\\ncolor or blue or red The sequence of the button...\\nYou can specify all this through CSS You specify all this through CSS And that\\'s why we have added CSS in website Now if I ask you about CSS? CSS is used to add styling in any page Now if I ask you about JavaScript JavaScript is used to program\\nlog in for the page layout If you want to program logic\\nfor any page layout For eg. If we take the example\\nof this particular website This is running through logic that\\nat first this have to be written After that \"Machine learning\" And then \"Welcome to CodeWithHarry\"\\nI did all this with the help of JavaScript How can I specify that what program\\nwill run after clicking on which button? I will specify this with the help of JavaScript With the help of JavaScript we\\ncan program the logic We can specify that if a user click\\non this button so this will happen Does page have to be reload or not?\\nWe can specify this with JavaScript If any user move their mouse cursor here So let us say tell him to be alert So to specify these type of things\\nI can use JavaScript JavaScript is used in logic programming\\nHow? You\\'ll know soon about this \"What happens when a user hovers on a text? \" When to hide or show elements? If you need to hide or show any element\\nso you can do that with the help of JavaScript You can write code in JavaScript\\nto hide any element Let me show you a very quick example I\\'ll move this downward For some reason I like it downwards\\nI don\\'t know why You can write JavaScript here\\nI\\'ll tell you how these things actually works So I\\'ll open my JavaScript console\\nwhere I can write my JavaScript And here I\\'ll quickly write\\n\"document.body.style.backgroundColor = \"red\" ; I repeat I\\'ve written this line\\nwhich says.... Turn the body\\'s background \\'red\\' And look as I press the \"Enter\" as I inject\\nthe JavaScript, this turns \\'red\\' And how to perform these things?\\nI\\'ll tell in Chapter 1 I\\'ll tell you, how you can do these things But for now I just want to tell you\\nhow you can control your page Now many of you will think that\\n\"BG color\" is a part of styling No, You can change the BG color through CSS But with JavaScript you can even control that With JavaScript you can choose to hide\\nor show anything & for as many minutes as you like With the help of JavaScript We\\'ll learn all these things And you know these things will be\\nin their place when I\\'ll reload the page Now let\\'s have a look on a beautiful\\nanalogy which I\\'ve written This is a very good analogy\\nthat\\'s why I refer it as \"Beautiful\" If HTML is your car\\'s body Let us assume you are a car manufacturer If you are not, then just assume And now I\\'ll search for a video on YouTube\\nwhich is related to car manufacturing And I\\'ve got a video\\nrelated to car manufacturing Now look at these cars Look at their unpainted body Just take those bodies as HTML And now if I paint this and\\nmake some designs... Add some designed lights in it Tail lights, head lamps\\nand add a good wind shield And make it like that everyone who\\nsee this will be amazed by its design For now no one will be amazed\\nby this car\\'s design There are cars, like sport cars You\\'ll be amazed by their design So if you see those type of cars The first one is its frame Along with that they have designed it So just like that with HTML\\nyou design the frame of your website And then you design it with the CSS So now if we forward it, I hope they have\\npainted it & make it looks good And whatever the car it is\\nIt\\'ll look good So look...... They haven\\'t showed this Look it is looking good now,\\nThey have painted it and done all the detailing So the conclusion is...\\nAt the first the car was like this And now this is how it looks You\\'ll find these types of car very amazing But I just want to tell you that... CSS is used for styling So what is this JavaScript Take JavaScript as car\\'s engine\\nI mean logic When to put break & at how much pressure How to change the gears What will happen after changing the gear\\nTake this as an example of JavaScript What will happen when the\\nuser will change the gear Now suppose there is a car which looks good but its\\nbreak doesn\\'t function & it\\'s engine is also broken So that car is also useless So this is role of\\nHTML, CSS & JS on a website The HTML is the frame of a website\\nCSS is the decoration And JavaScript is the frontend logic Why am I referring it as frontend logic So JavaScript is a type of client side logic\\nwhich means the logic that user can also see And backend logic is always hidden from us The server from where this website is coming\\nfor example my website was designed in Django So what logic is Django\\'s backend\\nis using I will never know I can only see the logic of frontend I can see it\\'s logic that how is it functioning\\nso I can see all the logic of frontend If you\\'re too confused, then don\\'t be Just understand that\\nJavaScript program the logic That what will happen by clicking on which button In how much time the action will\\nbe taken by clicking on which button Whatever the action your browser is taking\\nFor eg. If it displaying an Image So I hope you\\'ve understood this. We\\'ll start\\nlearning how to beautiful layout in this course We\\'ll soon learn to create beautiful layouts We\\'ll now install the VScode Now many of you will think why are we installing\\nthe VScode and what this is? And do we need to install something special to write basic HTML website Let me answer these questions\\nNO! We don\\'t need to do anything\\nfancy to create websites For eg. if I create a notepad file here If I select \"New\" --> \"Text Document\"\\nAnd if I name it \"codewithharry.html\" You can save an HTML file by\\n\".htm\" or \".html\" extension I\\'ve made this file And it is saying you\\'re changing the\\nextension from \".txt\" to \".html\" is it fine? Yes it is fine\\nI\\'ve changed it knowingly Now I\\'ll open it with notepad I\\'ll open it simple notepad which\\nevery computer have If you\\'re using a Mac or Linux So a basic editor is definitely shipped\\nwith each operating system So let\\'s move here & what we\\'ll do? We\\'ll click right --> View page source And we\\'ll copy this and paste it here I\\'ve simply pasted it I\\'m telling you the website won\\'t\\nlook 100% good Because there are styles which\\nI\\'m using through sever roots For now we won\\'t discuss this We\\'ll just keep in mind that it\\'s not this easy to\\nview page source of any website Copied it\\'s code and paste it in a notepad And we can copy that website,\\nIt\\'s not possible But maybe it is possible\\nLet\\'s have a look, so I\\'ve saved it I\\'ve opened it with notepad by clicking right I\\'ll open it with notepad by clicking right And after pasting all this text\\nI\\'ve saved it with \"Ctrl + S\" And now I\\'ll open this in Google Chrome It is copied to quite extent but not fully It is look same to quite extent To some extent we copied it But we were unable to copy it 100% Look here, this is different & this is different We\\'ll also understand its reason And we\\'ll understand its reason\\nbriefly in the upcoming chapters But for now just remember you\\ndon\\'t have to download anything Look the images are missing from here Style sheets took some time to be downloaded It is working, but some images are missing But again If you click on a Blog so it is not working So the conclusion is... You can copy the\\nwebsite but not 100% It\\'s not that easy to copy the website Now if you have understanding\\nso you can do, it\\'s not that difficult But it\\'s not that easy because... ....there are a lot of things.\\nWe\\'ll have a look at them But for now we\\'ll just keep in my mind\\nthat we can do coding with Notepad But the biggest drawback of using\\nNotepad for coding is... That you don\\'t have any support through\\nyour IDE or Text editor What I mean to say is..\\nIf you use a text editor like VScode Or you use a fully fledged IDE\\nfor eg. dream-weaver There are a lot of things in market nowadays I recommend VScode personally to everyone Because in VScode yo can perform every function.\\nI also have written this in notes Let me close all these tabs We can use any text editor of our choice You can also use notepad, But using notepad\\nwhile building a big website will be stupidity Why? Because if you\\'re using Notepad\\nthen you have to type each & everything And if you\\'re using VScode so it provides\\nsome suggestions when you are typing Now look, How to install VScode?\\nYou just have to open a new tab And you have to search \"Download VScode\" And if you\\'re using Mac or Linux\\nso you can download it accordingly I\\'m using 64-bit windows So I\\'ll download it by clicking on 64-bit\\nAnd look my VScode has started downloading It downloads very soon if you have a good internet\\nconnection and my internet speed is quite good So you just download it and after that You just simply have to open it\\nand then you have to install it It\\'s as simple as that Now I want to ell you a few things While installing it you have\\nto check some options Which means you\\'ll see some boxes and\\nyou have to select them I\\'m waiting till it downloads\\nAnd it has downloaded When we\\'ll open & run it So look, you\\'ve to read & accept\\nthe agreement and then click on \"Next\" And you have to check some options\\nlook I\\'ve checked them \"Add \"open with code\" to\\nWindows Explorer file context menu\" \"Add \"open with code\" action to\\nWindows Explorer directory context menu Register code as an editor\\nfor supported file types \"Add to PATH\" and I\\'ll tell\\nyou what will happen by these And then click on \"Install\" I\\'ve already installed but\\nI\\'m still installing it If you\\'ve installed it wrong. Let suppose\\nif you forget to check those options So you run it again just like me\\nyou won\\'t face any loss You won\\'t lose any important file I won\\'t launch it and I\\'ll click on \"Finish\" And if you follow every step and if\\nyou have installed the VScode as I told you And if you right click here so you\\'ll\\nfind an option here \"Open with Code\" We command it to show this option\\nwhen we were installing the VScode Click on \"Open with Code\"\\nand after that You\\'ll see all the files of\\nthis directory here Not here but here And you can create a new file by click here\\nand create a new folder by clicking here If you\\'re using VScode for the first time\\nthen don\\'t be scared Because you\\'ll get used to\\nonce you use it And then you have to click on \" + \" sign And...... you can create any file\\nfor eg. \"This.txt\" And you can write anything here This is some content on this file Save it And after this you have to click here\\nin you extension tab And after that you have to\\ninstall an extension Which is \"Live server\" Now many of you are using this very first time and\\nyou don\\'t have any idea about \"Live Server\" Just install this \"Live Server\"\\n\"Installing....\" And it is now installed Now as you can see\\n\"Live Server\" has been installed And I can open any file with \"Live Server\" Let me show you the file we created \"cwh.html\" If I right click on this file And click on \"Open with Live Server\" Look I\\'ll click on this & it is asking me\\nsomething and I\\'ll cancel it And after this look,\\nit\\'ll create a Live Server for me It creates a server like a website\\nand then display all the files You can open it directly with\\ndouble click on these files But this method is recommended\\nbecause this creates a web server for you And if you are using web server So the advantage of using a web server is...\\nYour files will actually be served through server When you\\'ll host your website If you serve your files through a web server\\nfrom the very beginning So everything will be identical and\\nthis method is highly recommended In comparison to this method So I\\'ll close this & this And I hope you\\'ve installed the VScode\\nwe can use any text editor of our choice Once again let me tell you Here I\\'m using VScode because it is\\nlightweight open-source from Microsoft You just simply have to visit the Google\\nand search \"VScode\" just install it like me You can write HTML even in Notepad Text-editors like VScode just\\nmake these things easier We\\'ll see how VScode make\\nthese things easier I\\'ll make this \"CWH.html\" file, a blank file Let me show you how VScode facilitate\\nin a great we-development If you add an \"exclamation mark\" (!) And then press \"Enter\" then\\nyou\\'ll get this template automatically So this was a very small thing to notice And if you press \"Alt + ↑\"\\nso look you can move this You can move all these things In fact you can move this line\\nupward & downward If you can perform all these actions\\nso you can definitely become a fast web-developer Compare to if you do coding in Notepad\\nNobody codes in Notepad We use VScode for these kind of features\\nfor example \"Live Server\"... ...And to be able to move this line To duplicate the line To use all these features and to set the\\nkeyboard shortcuts we use VScode I can zoom it by pressing \"Ctrl\"\\nand scroll my scroll wheel If I go to \"Settings\" and then\\nturn on this setting So you can zoom it by using your\\nmouse wheel if I check this setting So I can zoom it like this So to learn all these things we use VScode Or I\\'ll say to enjoy these features\\nwe use VScode Because we got a lot of things in\\nVScode and there\\'s nothing in Notepad To change the font size you have to press a lot keys So that\\'s why we won\\'t use Notepad\\nBut we can definitely use Notepad We just have to understand how to do things Now we\\'ll move to the chapter-1\\nwhere we\\'ll create our first website We\\'ll learn different kind of things\\nand learn about \"index.html\" And we\\'ll learn about we page structure What is a basic web page structure Let\\'s move to chapter-1 now So guys we\\'ll now move to Chapter-1\\nFirstly we\\'ll open this And the Chapter-1 is \"Creating pour first website\" Which will tell us how we can\\ncreate our website So before starting this let me tell you\\nthat every website is made up of HTML And we start building a website by creating\\na file named \"index.html\" So I\\'ll open my VScode And my VScode is opened in this folder In which folder?\\n\"html0\" I want to open VScode instead of this folder\\nbut in this folder Because that was the chapter-0 and the work\\nI done in Chapter-0 was in this directory And I want the work of Chapter-1\\nto be done here So I\\'ll do right click here and then\\nclick on \"Open with Code\" And as I clicked on \"Open with Code\"\\nyou can see this folder has been opened Does our old folder has been closed in VScode?\\nNO! Our old folder is still opened\\nso we\\'ll close it And we\\'ll maximize it and create\\na file here \"index.html\" Why \"index.html\" don\\'t we\\nhave any other name? \"index.html\" is special name for a file Which tells your web server to start with \"index.html\"\\npage when someone visit your website I repeat, this is the starting point This is the point from where your\\nwebsite starts to be visible Let me quickly show you from the\\nnotes what I\\'ve written \"This is an special file which is presented when the\\nwebsite root address is types\" For eg. if \"codewithhary.com\"\\nis purely an HTML website So if someone visit  \"codewithhary.com\" so\\nits \"index.html\" page will be visible first I hope this is clear Now let\\'s have a look at a basic HTML page\\nwhich we generated What I\\'ll do is..\\nI\\'ll type an exclamation mark (!) Now look \"Emmet Abbreviation\" is written here\\nWhat does \"Emmet Abbreviation\" means? Emmet is a tool which helps to write\\nHTML & CSS correctly Emmet is plug-in which help the web-developers\\nto write CSS & HTML correctly As soon as I type exclamation mark\\nand press the \"Enter\" Look I\\'ll get this boiler-plate-code of HTML Now if I start the second one\\njust as the first one If I start this so I only found\\n\"DOCTYPE html\" In the same manner I can do many things We\\'ll learn how to use these type of\\n\"Emmet Abbreviation\" through out the course When I typed the exclamation mark (!)\\nso look We got the boiler-plate-code generated here in \"index.html\" Look if I add \"h1\" in the body And let\\'s leave \"What h1 is? \" \"This is a heading\" And after this I\\'ll write a paragraph \"This is a paragraph\" And let\\'s leave for now\\nfor this heading & paragraph is Because we just want to generate\\nan HTML page And we want to open that in  a \"Live Server\" Because we want to see how our page\\nwill look in our server Look, as I opened this in a \"Live Server\" So what is written in the URL\\n\"127.0.0.1:5500\" Which is a server created by\\n\"Live Server\" extension After creating this server it is displaying\\n\"index.html\" page through this server But.... Listen to me carefully If I don\\'t write this \"index.html\"\\nthen what will happen? If I don\\'t type \"index.html\" in my URL bar\\neven then I\\'ll get the same page \"This is a heading, This is a paragraph\" If my page wasn\\'t named \"index.html\"\\nSuppose if I rename this file Let\\'s suppose if I rename\\nit by pressing \"f2\" And if I give it any random name\\nif I give it \"this.html\" instead of \"index.html\" You can name it after someone\\'s name\\nI\\'ll name it \"harry.html\" Will I be able to see anything after changing it\\'s name?\\nNO! Look it is saying you have 3 files in this\\nserver root which one do you want to see? At first there was \"index.html\" present\\nso it was displaying me the \"index.html\" It was telling me you have an\"index.html\"\\nfile so I\\'ll show you \"index.html\" Because \"index.html\" is an special name Which is displayed to you when you\\nvisit any server\\'s root That\\'s why \"index.html\" is an special name And you have to remember this name\\nwhen you\\'ll create a website I should have press \"f2\" And I\\'ve rename it to \"index.html\"\\nand after that If I reload it,\\nso look my document has appeared here Let\\'s have a look at this basic HTML page Let\\'s have a look what this is? If I visit \"codewithharry.com\"\\nthen it have its own page source It also contains all these tags We\\'ll look how we can understand\\nall these tags in a bare minimum page At first we\\'ll see a \"DOCTYPE html\" in every website\\nthis specifies that it as an HTML 5 document It is using HTML 5 What is the HTML tag?\\nIt is a root of an HTML page. And what is in the head?\\nThe meta data of the page. And what do we mean by Meta data?\\n\"Information about some already existing data\" Which means a brief data about already\\nexisting data, this is called meta data And what is the data?\\nData is the information You already know what data is... Let\\'s suppose you have stored someone\\'s data,\\naddress & phone number, so this is called data And what is the meta data?\\nIt means the data about the data This is already a data but meta data means\\n\"The data about the existing data\" What\\'s the description of this page and\\nwhat\\'s the title of this page There a lot of things which come under \"The Head\"\\nwe\\'ll see soon what are the those things And now as I opened this tag\\nnow I\\'ve to close this tag too We\\'ve to open almost all HTML tags\\nand we also have to close them There are a few tags which doesn\\'t need to be\\nclosed, and those tags are called empty tags But most of the tags which we use in\\nthe page & which contains the content We have to close those type of tags I\\'ve added opened \"Head\" tag\\n& then \"Title\" tag And then I\\'ve close the \"Title\" tag\\nand I\\'ve added the title \"Harry\\'s website\" Let me show you what \"Title\" does\\nNow here the title was a document I\\'m displaying \"Harry\\'s website\" here Now look here is some meta text her And what is the meta text?\\nMeta set means the encoding of this page is \"UTF-8\" I\\'ve specified that And now I\\'ve specified some more things, and by the way\\nit was generated by-default through Emmet So \"View port\" & \"XU-A compatible\"\\nwhat does these means? \"XU-A compatible\" is used for the\\nMicrosoft\\'s old browser\\'s compatibility And \"View Port\" is used to\\nchange the initial scale There are more tags similar to these 2\\ntags which we can use to build our website But first of all we\\'ll learn about\\nsome most important tags in HTML Body contains all the tags\\nwhich you\\'ll see on this web page The tags which are displayed\\nare present in the body Now look here, I\\'ve mentioned this in notes \"The main body of the page rendered by the browser\"\\nThis is the tag visible here And then I\\'ve added a paragraph tag\\nand a heading tag And then I\\'ve closed the body Because here my body closes and whatever\\nI want to render in the browser ends here That\\'s why I\\'ve added the closing\\ntag of body here So I hope you\\'ve understood this\\nhere is the HTML closing tag So there were the tags which we used to create this website Is this website looking good?\\nObviously not! This website is not looking that.\\nBut this is our first website So write \"Congratulations on your first website\" in the comments We\\'ve made the first website of this course\\nNo matter how it looks But this is our first website of this course\\nso make sure to write \"Congratulations\" in comments Now we\\'ll move back to the notes And I\\'ve written here\\n\"The difference between the tags & elements\" \"And how does your browser render your page\" So look it is simple, the tag is the container\\nfor the content or for the more HTML tags For eg. Look at the body tag\\nwhat does it contains? It contains some more tags And along with that it also\\ncontains some content Now if we talk about \"h1\" tag \"h1\" only contains a content \"This is a heading\"\\nIt doesn\\'t contain any tags So a tag can contain more tag\\nor directly a content Just like \"H1\" and the paragraph Now if you want to generate a\\ndummy paragraph through Emmet So firstly write \"p\" and then press the \"Enter\"\\nand it\\'ll complete automatically And then write \"lorem3\" As I wrote \"lorem3\"\\nthe three words have been generated Now if I write \"lorem30\"\\nwill it generate 30 words ? Obviously 30 words have been generated Now I\\'ll save it, look\\n30 words have appeared here And now if I want it to generate 300 words That\\'s also possible \"lorem300\"\\n300 words have been generated here If you ever have to build a website &\\nyou don\\'t have any idea what to write in this website \"lorem300\" \"lorem30\" \"lorem3\" \"lorem5\" \"lorem7\" And you\\'ll be able to see the\\ndummy text in your paragraph So \"This is a heading\" , \"This is a paragraph\"\\nand you can see \"Lorem300\" is written here And along with that.... Look here, this have been rendered And as soon as I save this page It is displaying the changes automatically after reloading By the way this is not a work of HTML This is the work if live server Live server is an extension which reflects\\nthe changes when you save your files Every time I build my website template\\nI always use the Live Server This extension was made  greatly in VScode Now we\\'ve understood\\n\"A tag is like a container\" Your HTML document is nothing\\nmore than this It is just a piece of code Whatever website you see on your daily basis\\nJust like if you\\'re seeing my website The actual website is not this one But this one This is the source code It\\'s about the code and not about the Images\\nor Red colored button or anything it contains Your website transports in the\\nform of this code In actual this code gets transported And then as soon as your browser gets\\nthis code it renders this code in this form So the code is provided to the\\nbrowser through server And browser renders the code in this\\nform which you usually see So now let\\'s understand, as soon as\\nyour browser gets this HTML document So your browser plays a major role in converting\\nthis code to a viewable form So I hope you got the point\\n\"How to display an HTML document\" Now let\\'s talk about the important notes\\nI\\'ve written some things here which are important \"Head and body tags are children of HTML tags\" So look, you can see your whole\\ncode in a way like this First you\\'ve specified your doc-type\\nthat your doc-type will be HTML You\\'ll find the first tag very unique\\nin compare to the other tags And then our main HTML page starts We\\'ve written HTML here And where is its closing tag?\\nHere in line #14 Things it contains.... What are they? Those are its children Now I\\'ll show you one thing very\\ninteresting from the VScode Now if you click on the left\\nside of \"The Head\" So look they have collapsed And now they have expanded Collapse-Expend, Collapse-Expend So now look the HTML contains\\nThe Head & The Body Understand this in a way that\\nHTML have 2 children \"Head\" & \"Body\" So when HTML have 2 children\\n\"Head\" & \"Body: So HTML is obviously the father\\nof \"Head\" & \"Body\" This is simple man, please don\\'t say\\nthat you didn\\'t understood this This is very simple thing So HTML is the parent of\\n\"Head\" & \"Body\" And what is the relation between\\n\"Head\" & \"Body\" They are \"Siblings\" ,\\nThis is the exact word we use \"Head\" & \"Body\" are Siblings Now look here I\\'ve written this \"Head & Body are the\\nchildren tags of HTML tags\" In the same way \"H1\" & \"Paragraph\"\\nare the children of? They are the children of \"Body\" Only in my case It is possible that you create a web page in which\\n\"H1\" & \"Paragraph\" is not the direct children of \"Body\" We\\'ll see this later But if we talk about this page So in this page \"H1\" & \"Paragraph\"\\nare the children of? But \"Head\" & \"Body\" will always be\\nthe children of HTML tags HTML is the parent of \"Head\" & \"Body\" tags\\nthis is the very simple thing Just understand this in a way that\\nRaghav is the son of Shubham So Shubham will be the Father of Raghav Most of the HTMl elements have\\nOpening & Closing Tags... ...With content in between\\nOpening & Closing Tags Just as we saw here that... H1 has the opening & closing tags\\nwith content in between Just like that \"Paragraph\" has the opening & closing\\ntags with content in between We\\'ve understood this Most of the HTMl elements have Opening &\\nClosing Tags With content in between We\\'ve discussed this \"Some HTML tags have no content\" There are some HTML tags which doesn\\'t\\ncontain any content for eg. \"BR\" And \"HR\" HTML\\'s HR tag And what is HTML\\'s HR tag?\\nThis is used to create a horizontal line We\\'ll talk about these tags Now let\\'s move downward and see\\n\"We can either use \\'.htm\\' or \\'.html\\' extension\" Along with \".html\" we can also\\nuse \".htm\" extension If we don\\'t add \"l\" in \".html\"\\nif we are lazy And we don\\'t want to type the whole \"html\"\\nbut we only want to type \"htm\" So you\\'re welcome you can do that too Your templates will work but I want\\nto give you a disclaimer Sometimes.....Let me show you the Live Server\\nis unable to detect the \"index.htm\" It detects \"index.html\" as a starting page But if you open the \"index.htm\" so you\\'ll\\nget this page totally rendered Which means we mostly have to\\nuse \".html\" extension And we don\\'t have to use \".htm\"\\nThere\\'s a reason for that Because if someone write code in backend or\\ncreate an extension or a piece of software So they sometimes forgot that they also have\\nto add \".htm\" as a supportive extension Because mostly \".html\" is used So if they haven\\'t added \".htm\" as a\\nsupportive extension for eg. Live Server They haven\\'t added this in Live Server\\nto detect the \".htm\" extension Which is why when we visit the route\\nit doesn\\'t display in case of \".htm\" Now I\\'ve changes the name of my file to\\n\"index.html\" that\\'s why it is displaying So we always have to use \".html\" But we have to be aware that \".htm\"\\nis also a valid extension of HTML files Now we\\'ll talk about the comments But first I want to tell you a fun feature\\nwhich you might already know \"inspect element or view page source options\" We got these 2 options What is \"Inspect elements\" used for? It is used to inspect any element For eg. I\\'ll show you on my website if I do Right Click on \"Browse Blog\"\\nand then click on \"Inspect\" Now look, blog browse blog If I change \"Browse Blog\" with\\nsomething like this \"Browse this website\" So look it has changed to\\n]\"Browse this website\" If I inspect \"Contact me\" And then if I change this with\\n\"Contact Shubham\" And then if I click anywhere. So look it\\nhas changed to \"Contact Shubham\" Is it changes for everyone? No this has changed here temporarily So it is not about that you can change\\nthis website by inspecting element If this was possible then You and I have\\nchanged a lot of website till now So you cannot change the backend But you can change the frontend\\nonly or your browser Just like I\\'ve shown you So you can do this But it\\'s not like that you can\\nchange the website for everyone So this is not possible When I\\'ll reload this page everything\\nwill be back to the normal So I hope you all have understood\\nthis \"Inspect Element\" And I\\'ve already told about \"View Page Source\" that\\nyou can see the whole page source by this feature One more thing I want to tell you\\nabout \"Inspect Element\" When you\\'ll click on this arrow\\nin the Google Chrome Then you can inspect any element For eg. If I want to inspect this one So look here is the button And then if I click here and then on\\nthis image so look this has been inspected And then if I click here... ...and then here so look this\\n\"Lambda Image\" has been inspected So I hope this is cleared to you Along with that I want to tell you if\\nyou click this on your phones So you can see how your website\\nlooks in different phones So this is how my website looks in Pixel 2 And if you open my website in\\niPad so this is how it looks And if you open this in Galaxy Fold\\nso this is how it looks So the website is responsive And what is the meaning of responsive? Responsive means if you use this website\\nin any device so it looks good It\\'s not like if you a build  website\\nfor just phones And if you\\'re opening that in a computer\\nso it is creating problem Responsive means that your website\\nis adaptive to all devices So nowadays responsiveness\\nis must for websites If any client ask you to build website So he won\\'t specify you 10 years ago responsiveness was an extra feature It was count as an extra feature provided\\nby a good programmer But nowadays it is a necessity not an option 10 years ago it was optional Nowadays internet is used more in\\nphones as compare to computers So that\\'s why people check it for phones first So that\\'s why the \"Mobile First\"\\nConcept is widely used \"Mobile First\" means the website\\nis first responsive in phones Whether or not responsive in computer\\nis second concern Because the mostly used devices for\\ninternet are Phones & Tablets And other pocket devices So I hope you\\'ve understood what responsiveness is And how to make a website responsive?\\nWe\\'ll create that through CSS & JS Bur now we\\'re only learning HTML So that\\'s why we\\'ll first finish this HTML step\\nand then we\\'ll move to the responsiveness You can use \"Inspect elements\" &\\n\"View Page Source\" And HTML elements =\\nStart Tag + Content + End Tag So the HTML element..... Whenever I talk about a tag so by that\\nI mean H1 or H1\\'s closing tag H1 is the opening tag And this H1 is a closing tag So whenever I\\'m saying \"Tag\"\\nI mean this tag or this one BUt when I\\'m saying \"Element\"\\nso I mean this whole line This whole \"This is a heading\"\\nis an element So it is an element & look here HTML elements =\\nStart Tag + Content + End Tag So Start Tag & Content & End Tag\\ncreates an HTML element Now let\\'s talk about comments\\nwhat are comments? Let\\'s suppose if I want to\\nwrite something here I want to write why I added this heading I want to specify this, I want to write\\n\"this heading will be changed in future\" Future is pronounced as Fu-Tu-Rey Sorry it is written as Fu-Tu-Rey\\nbut pronounced as \"Future\" So now if I move to here The problem is, It is also displaying on my web page I just want to write this but\\nI don\\'t want to display it But Google Chrome is\\ndisplaying my line So is there a way for me to\\nwrite notes here? For eg. I want to write here\\n\"Improve below paragraph\" So let\\'s suppose if I want to\\nimprove this paragraph So what will I do? What to do when I don\\'t want it to display here? I\\'ve written \"Improve below paragraph\" here But I don\\'t want it to be visible\\nbecause these are my notes These are the notes which I don\\'t\\nwant to display to the user But I want to keep these notes for me As I\\'ll press \"Ctrl + / \" Look it has been converted to a comment And I\\'ll again press \"Ctrl + / \" \"this heading will be changed in future\"\\nhas been commented out This means it won\\'t be displayed\\nin my web page These are the comments Things which exist but you don\\'t want to\\ndisplay them in your web page... ...Are called comments What are the comments?\\nLet\\'s read \"Comments in HTML are used to mark\\ntext which shouldn\\'t be parsed\" What do parsed means? When this source code of HTML\\nconverts in this form This is called parsing Google Chrome is reading this code & then displaying\\nit in this form to the user, this is called parsing Parsing is called to understand\\nthis code, tags & elements So now if I want it to ignore some lines\\nof text which I don\\'t want to display I\\'ll do right click > view page source\\nso look it has been ignored \"this heading will be changed in future\"\\nhas been ignored And \"Improve this paragraph\"\\nis also ignored I want it to be ignored by Google Chrome\\nso I made it a comment And Google Chrome has obeyed me\\nand it has been ignored So these are the comments And I also have written comments here If you use Notepad for your HTML coding\\nso you have to write this yourself You can use \" Ctrl + /\" to do\\ncomment & uncomment Comment means to comment any text Uncomment means to uncomment any\\ntext which is already commented Commenting-Uncommenting....\\nAnd we\\'ll use this terminology a lot While programming I\\'ll leave \"Improve below paragraph\"\\n& \"this heading will be changed in future\" I\\'ll leave all these as they are\\nand read the next point \"Case sensitivity\"\\nIs HTML a case sensitive language?  NO! HTML is a case insensitive language I mean if you use lowercase or uppercase\\nit doesn\\'t matter it\\'ll work properly If I write this tag as a capital-P And if I change this to a capital-P So will my browser show it correctly? Yes it\\'ll show it correctly, look if I reload\\nit so a capital-P has been appeared here So I can use uppercase or lowercase I can use any but lowercase tags\\nare highly recommended I know it\\'ll work but lowercase tags\\nare highly recommended This is a whole element & \\'P\\' is an opening tag And this \\'P\\' is a closing tag I hope you got the point Now we\\'ll move to chapter 1\\'s practice set And we\\'ll practice some things And we\\'ll also grasp these things which we\\nunderstood & make sure to download the notes I\\'ve written these notes for you\\nso please download them These notes are very helpful And I\\'ll provide the PDF of these\\nnotes to download in the description So I hope you\\'ve understood this\\nHTML website\\'s structure You\\'ll also get the codes & notes &\\neverything I\\'m writing here Let\\'s move in to chapter 1 practice set So guys this is the chapter 1 practice set\\nwhich I\\'m opening here And I\\'ve added some questions in it\\nwhich will help you to understand HTML better Now look \"Inspect your favourite website &\\nchange something on the page which is displayed\" This is a very simple exercise But I want you do this on your own Because if you inspect a website\\nso first take away you\\'ll get is... ...That you\\'ll learn to change\\nyour favourite websites And that can be any website\\nI\\'ll change the \"CodeWithHarry\" website So now we are on \"codewithhary.com\"\\nand I\\'ll show you changing this By the way I already did that one time before Lets suppose I want to change \"Contact me\"\\nAnd I want to change it to... \"Contact this person\" So this is how I can change this\\nand make sure to try this on your own Try to change it It\\'s not important to change this website\\nand I know that 90% of you will change \"codewithhary\" Try another website You can change anything\\nor you can also use \"codewithhary Try to change your favourite website\\nit is very fun when the web page is changed Very few people are familiar with that And those who know is good for theirselves Go to your favourite website & try to view the page\\nsource and write the exact lines of code Does it clone the website? Why? Visit any website & do right click >\\nview page source And see if you\\'re able to clone\\nthat website or not Now what I\\'ll do is... I\\'ll try to clone this website but you can\\nuse any website of your choice You can clone \"Wikipedia\" And I\\'ll open the \"Wikipedia\" and then\\nI\\'ll do right click > view page source And I\\'ll copy it\\'s source And after copying this source\\nlook here are many things Here are a lot of stuff And I\\'ll create a file\\n\"practice.html\" And I\\'ll open it with \"Live Server\" So look this is the Wikipedia which I copied And this one is the actual Wikipedia So you can see that the website is not copied exactly\\nand you should know the reason about that What was the reason that the website\\nwas unable to be cloned? So look when you use CSS in your website So you sometimes use relative links There\\'s an absolute link\\nWhat is absolute link? If I command my computer to visit \"codewithhary.com\"\\nso this is the absolute path of this website But how can I command it to visit relative\\nI can command it to visit \"codewithhary.com/blogs\" Which website\\'s \"/blogs\" ?\\n\"codewithhary\" So if you visit \"/blogs\" so you\\'ll be here\\nAnd if you visit \"/videos\" so you\\'ll be here If you click on \"/contact me\"\\nso you\\'ll be here And  if you click on \"/start watching\"\\nso you\\'ll be here When you visit \"/videos/Java tutorial for beginners\"\\nso you end up on this page So they have added a mixture of absolute &\\nrelative links in the source of Wikipedia And your version of Wikipedia is unable\\nto find the relative links... ...Which are related to \"Wikipedia.org\" But it is trying to find that pages\\non \"127.0.0:5500\" Let me show you this but if you\\'re unable to\\nunderstand this so please ignore it But if you are able to understand\\nthis then well & good But if you are not.... then you\\'ll learn it\\ndon\\'t be tensed about it So look here are some pages Which were unable to load which is why\\nit is showing the error And those things are unable\\nto be load because... You haven\\'t added the paths correctly So to clone a whole website you\\'ve to do some\\nmore things we\\'ll talk about them later So I just wanted to make you do exercise for\\ncloning a website through this question So you can have a good idea about it is not\\nthat easy to clone a website So it is not that easy So I wanted to tell you this Write any HTML code inside a text file.\\nDoes it work if you write it using Notepad? Will it work if you execute it using Notepad? Now open this And I\\'ll provide you a new text document After writing \"New text document\"\\nI\\'ll write... ...\"Notepad.html\" I\\'ll do one thing, for now\\nI\\'ll just change it to \"notepad.txt\" And I\\'ll add some HTML code in it And I\\'ll copy HTML code form here Have you noticed something?\\n\"Notepad.txt\" is here VScode doesn\\'t perform any type of magic It only does what you can do with Notepad But because you can perform all those task here in\\norganized manner so that\\'s why we use VScode Or you use an alternate of VScode So I\\'ll copy this in \"notepad.txt\" I\\'ve opened \"notepad.txt\" twice\\nbut no problem So I\\'ve done \"This is heading will be changed\\nin future\" something like this So now I\\'ll change \".txt\" with \".html\" I\\'ll click on \"YES\" and then.... I\\'ll open my \"notepad.html\" with Live Server Or instead of opening it with Live Server\\nif I click on this twice So also then it\\'ll work \"Notepad.html\" is working So why are we using Live Server\\nwhen it is supported in Notepad We are using Live Server because it\\ncreates a server in actual Whenever you\\'ll do coding in HTML\\nor create any website in future So all files will be serve\\nthrough a server If we use a server from the beginning\\nso that\\'ll be good for us So that\\'s why we use Live Server So I hope this practice set was\\nvery beneficial for you And you\\'ve understood this easily Now we\\'ll move to chapter-2 Where we\\'ll learn about some basic tags I\\'ll see you in chapter-2 So guys we are now on chapter-2\\nin which we\\'ll learn about some basic tags And we\\'ll use those tags to create some websites So I\\'ll quickly open the chapter-2 I\\'ll open the PDF which I created for you And as you can see I\\'ve written\\nabout some basic tags here We can add elements inside the body\\ntag to define the page layout We\\'ve learned that we have a body tags\\nwhich is rendered by the body And we can add some tags in that body tag\\nwhich will be visible to us in the browser We\\'ve learned about H1 tag And we\\'ve also learned about the \"Paragraph\" tags And we learned that when we use these 2 tags\\nthen we got a Heading & Paragraph How many more such tags are there?\\nAnd what type of tags can we use? And what are tags which we can use to\\ncreate a good looking website? Or I\\'ll say a good enough website So we are going to learn more about this We can add elements inside the body tag\\nto define the page layout I\\'ll talk about HTML element\\nWhat do I mean by HTML Element HTML elements means An opening tag\\n& a closing tag Whenever we write an HTML tag we write\\n2 tags \"Opening Tag & Closing Tag\" And the content in between This content can be a text or more\\nopening & closing tags So that\\'s why I\\'ve written this as content I can also\\nwrite this as  then any heading and then  Now pay attention to one thing in\\nOpening & Closing tag Whenever we write a tag inside\\nthis angular brackets And we have to close that, so what we\\'ll do?\\nWe add a forward slash(/) And we write the name of that tag\\nwhich means  And it becomes a closing tag We\\'ll open & close all the tags\\nin the way in HTML We\\'ll create HTML elements here I\\'ll click right > Open with code And this folder has been opened in VScode So now look I\\'ve opened this folder in VScode Now we\\'ll create a website here and the name for\\nHTML page will be \"index.html\" for obvious reasons Now I\\'ll add an exclamation mark(!) here\\nand an emmet abbreviations will appear I\\'ll press the \"Enter\" And then press the \"Tab\" x3\\nAnd now I\\'m inside the body Now I\\'ll write H1 here Now what Emmet is saying?\\nIt is saying \" Where will you write the whole H1? \" Emmet is saying \"My son....\" \"...Don\\'t write the whole H1 tag....\" \"....Just press the \\'Enter\\' and I\\'ll see the rest\" Emmet is so good There are very few people like\\nEmmet in this world Just write \"H1\" and then\\n\"List of books\" You\\'ve written \"List of books\" Or I\\'ll write \"Books to read\" \"Books to read\" I\\'ll write whatever the heading\\nI want to add And then I\\'ll write \"P\" And then I\\'ll write\\n\"There are a lot of books to read for you\" And now I\\'ll save it and then I\\'ll open it\\nwith Live Server & you know what will happen And it\\'ll open in Liver Server and then I\\'ll be\\nable too see this heading & paragraph So look I\\'ve written an opening tag & a closing\\ntag & then a content in between What is meant by content? Content can be a text or a combination\\nof opening & closing tag For eg. we have     tags in the body And in turn we have some content in  Which is \"Books to read\" So this is how we define the HTML elements Element is the combination of\\nopening tag, content & closing tag And what is tag? Here are the\\nsome example of tags Tags means anything which is written in this way Element is the combination of all these 3 things Let\\'s talk about HTML attributes What are the HTML attributes &\\nwhy do we need them? Sometimes you have to supply some\\nmore information along with tags For eg. if I move to my VScode So there\\'s no need for me to supply more\\ninformation with this H1 tag I just want to tell\\nwhat is the content in H1 tag I only want to tell this But if I use an anchor tag here\\nI want to tell you about one more tag Which is an anchor tag If you write \"A\" and then pressed \"Enter\" So look an attribute has been added here\\nIt saying \"Please tell in which URL I\\'ve to go\" First let me tell you about the anchor Tag If you click on a text which is in Anchor Tag\\nso it\\'ll redirect you to a URL So it is asking for the location So this is an attribute href = what? It is asking you You have to add \"href = https://codewithharry.com\" And then write the content \"Click here to go to Harry\\'s website\" Suppose you\\'ve written something like this Now when you look at it you\\'ll found a\\nlink on \"Click here to go to Harry\\'s website\" And when you click on it you\\'ll be redirected\\nto \"codewithharry.com\" So what is the \\'href\\' written\\nwith the anchor tag In actual \\'href\\' is a link to a website And it\\'ll open whenever you\\'ll\\nclick on this text So if you want to be redirected to\\n\"codewithharry.com\" by clicking on the text... ...\"Click here to go to Harry\\'s website\" So yo can add the website’s\\naddress in the href So this is the attribute And there can be more than one attribute\\nFor eg. I could\\'ve add some attributes here \"class = \"me\" \" And \"id = \"that\" \" So this is how you can add a lot of attributes I\\'ll remove these 2 attributes And I\\'ll only leave 1 attribute here\\nwhich is of \\'href\\' So this is the attribute How can you write the attribute? First of all the name of the attribute and then \" = \"\\nand then the attribute in double quotes(\" \") Can I use the single quotes(\\' \\') ? Yes I can use them So look we can use single quotes(\\' \\') Will it work if I write this in single quotes(\\' \\')\\nYes definitely it will work! So look I\\'ve added \"href =\" in single quotes(\\' \\')\\nthis will definitely work So what is the difference between\\nsingle quotes(\\' \\') & double quotes(\" \") ? Look you can use any one from the\\nsingle quotes (\\' \\') & double quotes (\" \") But the attribute you\\'re about to enter\\ncontains a double quotes (\" \") For some weird reason let\\'s suppose\\nthis will be my website So you cannot use the double quotes (\" \") here If you\\'ve used the double quotes (\" \")\\nthen it would have confused... ...in the closing tags So it\\'ll think that you\\'ve only written this\\nmuch after the \\'href\\' So it\\'ll be confused and can also\\ngive a syntax error So if you\\'re using the double quotes (\" \") in your attribute\\'s\\ncontent so remember to use single quotes(\\' \\') in the outer and vice versa if you\\'re using the single quotes(\\' \\')\\nin attribute so use the double quotes (\" \") Or else you can use anyone from the\\nsingle quotes(\\' \\') & double quotes (\" \") But in the end, I\\'ll advice you to\\nmaintain the consistency. What you have to do?\\nYou\\'ve to maintain the consistency If you\\'re using the single quotes(\\' \\')\\nthen keep using them And if you\\'re using the double quotes (\" \")\\nthen keep using them So I\\'ll remove these double quotes (\" \") from here Because here the URL of the website is this one &\\nit doesn\\'t contain the double quotes (\" \") So now we\\'ve understood this So I\\'ve written in the notes for you \"Attribute used to add\\nmore information corresponding to an HTML tag\" Which means an HTML tag is already written And you\\'re using this to add some additional\\ninformation corresponding to that attribute For eg. if there\\'s an anchor tag and you\\'re specifying\\nthe href attribute and writing it\\'s value in it So first the name of the attribute and then after \" = \" the\\nvalue of attribute in double quotes (\" \") or single quotes(\\' \\') And then you can write the tag as usual Now I\\'ve written here we either use single quotes (\\' \\')\\nor double quotes (\" \") in attribute And now comes the Heading Tag Let\\'s discuss the Heading Tag Whenever you build your website or any\\npage of your website Then you would like to give it a heading Heading Tag is used to mark\\nHeadings in HTML If you want to make any text a Heading\\nso you can use the Heading Tag And you can use from the H1 to the H6\\nfor the headings H1 means the most important Heading H2 means less important than H1\\nH3 means less important than H2 H4 means less important than H3\\nAnd H6 means the least important heading H6 specify the least important heading If you use the H6 then it is the\\nleast important heading So use the H1 for the most important heading \"We have tags for the most important to\\nthe least important headings\" Which means we have the tags for the most important\\nto the least important heading in the HTML I\\'ve written a not here You\\'ll write all these code and\\nI\\'ll also show you this by typing But first let me type this & show you\\nso you can have a good idea about this What will be the difference you notice when you\\nwrite from the H1 all the way to the H6 I\\'ll also tell you about a trick Now if you press \"Alt\" key\\nin your keyboard And then whenever you click somewhere,\\na cursor will appear And if you click there again... ...the cursor will be gone The benefit of making multiple cursors\\nis you can change text easily Just like I\\'ve changed these 2 to H2 And then you can change then to H3\\nby pressing \"Alt\" key And then you can change this to H4 And then again.... I\\'ve made a mistake,\\nI\\'ve made H4 twice I just had to change it to H4 here and here And then I\\'ve to add H5 here and\\nI also have to remove the cursor And then by pressing \"Ctrl + D\" I\\'ll add a\\ncursor here and change it to H6 So now look.... I\\'ve closed it mistakenly That\\'s good that I managed to saved it I\\'ve saved it & look how this\\npage is rendering H1 will look like this And may be this too is H1,\\nI\\'ve written H1 twice if I\\'m not wrong Yes I\\'m not wrong, I\\'ve written H1 twice\\nNo worries So this is the H1, H2, H3, H4, H5 & H6 When we move to H6 from the H1\\nso not only their size changes Their importance also decrease What does it means? Whenever the search engines like Google\\nwill read your page so they\\'ll think.. ...That you\\'re writing the most important\\nheading in the H1 And after that as you\\'re using the H2, H3, H4....\\nYou\\'re decreasing the importance Which means if you\\'ve used the\\nH1 for \"Books to read\" So the search engine will think Or any bot who\\'s crawling your\\nwebsite will think That the H1 is the primary topic of your page So you have to use the H1.....H6 tags very wisely\\nif you want the search engine optimization And if you want to convey your page\\'s content\\neasily with any bot, crawler or a search engine So use the tag wisely You never have to use the H1-H6 tags to\\ndefine the sizes of the headings I\\'ve seen some people who learned\\nthe HTML recently use the H1-H6 tags In a way to define the sizes of the heading For eg.\\nH1 for the bigger heading & H6 for the smaller We don\\'t have to do this and we have to\\nuse the heading carefully We have to write the paragraph\\nwith the paragraph tag And we have to write the headings\\nwith the heading tag We have to use them carefully Now look, I\\'ve told you about paragraphs, anchors and all that\\nNow let\\'s move back to the notes I\\'ve written something here\\nwhich I\\'ve just told you Note:- We should not use HTML headings\\nto make text thick or bold We don\\'t have to use the headings to\\ndetermine the size of the texts Then in what purpose we have\\nto use the headings? We have to use the headings when we are\\nactually writing the headings And not when we\\'ve to change the\\nsize of the text or design them I hope you got the point Now we\\'ll move forward to the next tag\\nwhich we have already seen Paragraph Tag And what does paragraph tag do? I\\'ve told you it is used to add paragraph\\nand how you can add paragraph And if you want to change the paragraph\\nso you can change it like this When I\\'ll write \"lorem34\" so\\n34 words will appear By the way look a Horizontal scroll bar\\nhas appeared here And if you want a view like this instead\\nof this horizontal scroll bar Let me show you what I\\'m talking about Now if we click on \"Toggle Word Wrap\"\\nSo this scroll bar will disappear And Line No. will appear Which means in actual this is not the line #17 But only this content is line #17 But this is displaying you in multiple lines\\nso you don\\'t have to scroll it horizontally This is called Word Wrap And we can see the Word Wrap functionality\\nin a lot of IDEs So I\\'ve enabled my Word Wrap So the lines which are actually bigger than\\nmy screen width, will be shown like this So line #17 is actually this big Line #18 is this big\\nthat it is fit within a line So the bigger lines will be shown in the same screen\\nwidth and I don\\'t have to use the horizontal screen bar And I definitely have to use\\nthe vertical scroll bar I hope you\\'ve understood... ...What is Word Wrap and we should use that So we\\'ve learned Paragraph Tag\\nand the Lorem trick Whenever you write the \"Lorem\" so don\\'t think if you write\\n\"Lorem45\" in Notepad so a text of 45 words will be generated This is the feature of Emmet which is\\nbuilt-in feature of VScode You don\\'t have to install the Emmet\\nit is build-in feature of VScode I hope you\\'ve understood this And if the Emmet is not working in your VScode\\nthat means you have installed a buggy extension It usually happens that if you\\ninstall a buggy extension Or an extension which disables your Emmet\\nknowingly or accidentally So you can face problem By the way Emmet works\\nperfectly 99.99% of the times And this case is very rare, but if this happens\\nso restore the VScode and it\\'ll be fix I hope you\\'ve understood this Now we\\'ll move back to the notes And we\\'ll have a look on Anchor Tag What is Anchor Tag? Anchor Tag is used to add\\nlinks to an existing content inside an HTML Page Which means if you want to add\\nlinks in an HTML page It means if you want to redirect the user\\nto a different page within the site Or you want to redirect the user globally to a\\ndifferent website so you can the Anchor Tag Just like I\\'ve added an absolute URL\\nhere of \"Codewithharry.com\" So if someone clicks on this so they\\'ll be\\nredirected to the Harry\\'s website If I write \"href = /about.html\" And if I press the \"tab\" key &\\nwrite here \"Go to about\" So it\\'ll try to visit the \"about.html\" I\\'ll create an \"about.html\" here\\nI\\'ll change the Title with \"about\" And I\\'ll write \"Lorem45\" by writing a paragraph And then I\\'ll write \"This is about\" A very simple thing From \"index.html\" as I click on \"Go to about\" So look I\\'ve been redirected to \"about.html\" This is the relative link So I\\'ll write one thing here\\n\"Example of absolute link and example of...\" \"Example of absolute link\" And I\\'ll comment it out because I don\\'t\\nwant it to be displayed on my website And then.... \"Example of relative link\" And it is the example of relative link which you\\'re commanding\\nto redirect the user to about.html within the server And what are you commanding here?\\nYou\\'re commanding \"https://\" Which means there\\'s a website on internet\\n\"codewithharry\" redirect on that So these two are different The difference is in this you can visit\\nglobally from any computer But in this you can only visit when\\nyou\\'re in a same server Which means you have to only use the\\nrelative link when you\\'re in your server Actually I\\'m using Live Server so I know\\nthat here\\'s an \"about.html\" So that\\'s why I\\'ll go to the \"about.html\" But if you send this to someone else and\\nask them to go to \"/about.html\" So he won\\'t be able to visit\\nthis file in my server But if you\\'re hosting you website so\\nyes he can visit your about.html I hope you got the point.\\nBut if you\\'re confused, so don\\'t be Simply absolute link means you\\'re\\nproviding the full address And relative link means you\\'re telling\\nwhere you want to go form here Which means you have the same server What is my server right now?\\nThis is the URL of my server \"/about.html\" so I\\'m now in\\n\"/about.html\" I can press the back button and\\nI\\'ll be on my previous position I hope you\\'ve understood the Anchor Tag And it\\'s href attribute &\\nabsolute and relative links Now we\\'ll talk about the \"Image Tags\" Image Tag is very simple & straight forward\\nthey are used to add images in your HTML page It means if you want to add images\\nin your HTML page So you can use the IMG tag\\nthere\\'s also it\\'s attribute which is SRC Which tell you which image you want to add\\n Or the complete address of the image For eg. if I want to use the Image tag here And if I write \"Image Tag\" and then.... I\\'m changing the line with \"Ctrl + Enter\" By the way\\nmany people ask me about the keyboard shortcuts So I\\'m using \"Ctrl + Enter\" And then I\\'ll write \"IMG\"\\nand I\\'ll add an address in the SRC And I\\'ll add the address of\\nany image in the SRC I\\'ll search for the images on the internet And we can search for any image And I\\'ll visit the \"unsplash\" BTW \"Unsplash\"\\nis a very API. Let me tell you why And firstly I\\'ll visit the URL of this image And I\\'ll paste that in SRC And look this image has been\\nadded on my page So if this is how I can images on my\\nweb page if I want to Obviously it is not looking quite good\\nbut this is how we add images Now what is \"ALT\" Suppose if this image is\\nunable to load by any reason So what text you want to display? Let\\'s suppose you want to show\\n\"Human Image\" I know this is very weird but \"ALT\" means the text that\\nshould be shown when the image is unable to load If I change this to \"Unsplash4.com\"\\nso this image might not load And I\\'ll be able to see \"Human Image\"\\nwhich means the \"ALT\" And now if I fix the URL which I messed up So as I\\'ll save it then I won\\'t be\\nable to see the \"ALT\" Which means the text in the \"ALT\" will only be shown\\nwhen the image is unable to be load I hope this is clear, because this is\\nvery simple & straight forward Let\\'s move back to the notes And I forgot to mention about the \"ALT\" in the notes\\nbut Emmet asked me about the \"ALT\" automatically BTW I want to tell you one more thing\\nwhen you\\'ll put your mouse arrow on it So look it displaying some documentation And this is displaying about the image URL What you have to write in SRCs and which is the\\nParagraph and do you want to open MDN reference? So it\\'ll redirect you to the\\n\"developer.mozilla.org\" So I hope you’ve understood how you can open the\\ndocs within the server by clicking on some links We\\'ll now quickly move to the notes of chapter-2\\nand learn \"Bold, Italic & Underline Tags\" BTW I\\'ve told you about the relative & absolute tag\\nso the same thing is applicable to the images I\\'ve save it as image and save\\nit in chapter-2 folder With a name \"image.jfif\" It\\'s extension will be add automatically\\n\"image.jfif\" Look this \"image.jfif\" has appeared here Now I\\'ll add another image tag here And after copy-pasting it I\\'ve made a replicate line shortcut with (Ctrl + D)\\nFrom the keyboard shortcuts I\\'ve already mentioned that in a video earlier\\n\"Learn VScode in one video\" Give it a shot later But now focus on how I\\'ll add the\\n\"/image.jfif\" in the SRC And I\\'ll render the same image again So look this image has the SRC If I do \"Open image in new tab\"\\nso this is it\\'s source But if I do \"open image in new tab\" here So this \"image.jfif\" has been downloaded Which means the source of\\nimage is \"image.jfif\" I hope this thing is cleared to you That what is the source of this image and how\\nyou can use the relative & absolute link... ...To display the images So the link of this image is absolute image\\nSorry! Absolute source URL And this is the relative URL Because you added \"/image.jfif\" which means\\nthe \"image.jfif\" from my server And here you\\'ve added image from\\n\"images.unsplash.com/.....\" URL So I hope you\\'ve understood how to\\nwrite the absolute & relative URLs Now we\\'ll move back to the notes And we\\'ll talk about the\\n\"Bold, Italic & Underline Tags\" We can use \"Bold, Italic & Underline Tags\"\\nto highlight our texts So let me give you a demo of\\n\"Bold, Italic & Underline Tags\" So I\\'ll write \"Bold, Italic & Underline Tags\" And obviously I\\'ll comment it out And I\\'ll add a  tag here and then\\nI\\'ll write \"This is bold\" And then I\\'ll add an  tag here\\nand I\\'ll write \"This is Italic\" And then I\\'ll add an  tag here\\nand I\\'ll write \"This is Underline\" And after saving it, Look\\nthese tags has appeared here \"This is bold\" \"This is Italic\" And \"This is Underline\"\\nMaybe it has appeared twice Ah.... I forgot to save it So here it appears once\\n\"This is Bold\" This is Italic & This is Underline\\nBTW I\\'ll do one thing here I\\'m commenting out both the image tags\\nThe reason being.... They are occupying a lot of space\\nyou can uncomment them later Now our page is looking quite clean So I\\'ve written \"This is Bold\"\\n\"This is Italic\" & \"This is Underline\" Did you notice something? \"This is Bold\" \"This is Italic\" &\\n\"This is Underline\" appeared in a single line Which means if I add a new line here Even then this new line won\\'t be displayed As you can see new line has not been displayed\\nand I\\'ve even saved the page So even if I add multiple new lines,\\nthat won\\'t effect it\" Or if I add some extra spaces..\\nLook how many extra I\\'ve added here Here I\\'ve written \"This is      Italic\" And what does rendered here?\\n\"This is Italic\" This means the HTML ignores the\\nextra spaces & new lines It won\\'t effect HTML if you\\'ve\\nadded new line explicitly This totally means that you cannot\\nadd new line here in this manner So how will you add new line? I\\'ve already told you in my notes With the help of  tag  tag is used to create\\nline breaks in HTML Which means if you want \"This is Bold\" \"This is Italic\" &\\n\"This is Underline\" in different lines so you must use  tag  is an empty tag\\nand this is how you can write  tag And wherever you\\'ll add  tag\\na new line will be added I\\'ll expect a new line after \"This is Bold\"\\nand \"This is Italic\" And I won\\'t expect a new line after\\n\"This is Underline\" So look new lines appeared after these 2 But there is no new line after \"This is underline\"\\nSo prove this I\\'ll add \"This is underline2\" And it\\'ll appear on the same line As you can see So I hope this thing is cleared to you that how you\\ncan highlight your text within the page Big & Small tags We have Big & Small tags in HTML\\nand we can use them to... This is big or This is small I\\'ll add the \"Small\" in \"This is small\" This is small And as you can see I\\'ve got Big\\n& Small of different size And now after this we\\'ll talk about how you\\ncan add a horizontal divider in HTML There\\'s and  tag for it As I\\'m explaining you these topics Just as I explained the topic\\nof heading & Paragraph I\\'ll write \"Heading & Paragraph\" And I\\'ll comment it out And after heading 7 paragraph\\nI explained you about Links I want that I\\'ll separate them\\nwith a horizontal line And then I explained you\\nabout the Image tag So I want it to separate it\\nwith a horizontal line And then I explained you about the \"Bold, Italic & Underline\"\\nand I want to separate it with a horizontal line I\\'ve written    here\\nand look I\\'m able to see the horizontal lines So why am I seeing this horizontal line?\\nBecause I\\'ve added  tags here And now I haven\\'t displayed these images here\\nso let me display it Where is my image?\\nHere it is Now you\\'ll able to see this properly So as you can see these are the links\\nthis is the image & this one is the \"Bold & italic\" part I\\'ll shorten the image a little bit and I can do\\nthat by using the height & width attribute If I add \"width = 121px\" So it\\'s width will be 121px So this is how I can set its width & height But it\\'s highly recommended that you set the height & width of\\nany image with the help of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) We\\'ll learn about this later But for now we\\'ll move forward and\\nlearn about more tags Which are the subscripts &\\nsuperscripts tags We add subscripts &\\nsuperscripts as follows If you want to add subscripts What is the meaning of subscript? Subscript is used for.... for eg.\\nif I want to write a chemical formula formula of carbon dioxide CO₂\\nSo how will I write that? This is how I\\'ll write. First let me write\\nsubscripts & superscripts And here I\\'ll write \"H\"... Let me first write a paragraph here I\\'ll write C.... and then O..... and then... I\\'ll write a subscript and then I\\'ll\\nwrite a \"2\" inside it So look this is how CO₂ will render here I\\'ll also remove the space from here\\nso CO₂ will render like this Which is ideally looking good\\nso this is how you can write CO₂ Now let\\'s suppose if you want to write an equation And you have to write (a² + b² + c)\\nsomething like this So what you can write? You can write \"a\" and then a superscript and\\nthen \"2\" so this is how you can write (a²) And then let us say you want to write (+bx) And then (+c)\\nSo this is how you can write that Let me zoom it of you haven\\'t seen it yet By the way I’m zooming it and I\\'ve done 500%\\nso that\\'s why it is looking quite big I haven\\'t done any magic ( a² + bx + c )\\nLet me change it to to ( ax² ) You can write any equation So I\\'ve written ( ax² + bx + c )\\nI\\'ll reset it with (Ctrl + scroll) By clicking on reset\\nIt\\'ll be reset to its original size Now we\\'ll talk about \"Pre Tag\" Now what is \"Pre Tag\" ? I\\'ve already shown you that HTML always\\nignore extra spaces & new lines Now if we want to display a text\\nas we have written it For eg. If I take any random python code\\nand I\\'ll search for it If I find any Python code....\\nfrom anywhere\\nthere\\'s nothing to be worried about Let\\'s take a code form \"python.org\" Let\\'s take a code form the python docs And if I can find any small code\\na small one Python please give me a small code Let\\'s suppose I want to take this\\nand I\\'ve copied it And then I\\'ve pasted it with a hope.. ...that It\\'ll be displayed as it is\\nI mean all the new lines will appear And when I\\'ll save it...\\nI\\'ve to face disappointment Because this whole code has been\\ndisplayed in a single line Neither these new lines appear\\nnor these extra spaces It did preserve nothing But if I want these type of extra spaces\\n& new lines to be preserved Which means I should get the text as it is So what will I do?\\nI can use the \"Pre Tag\" Which means I\\'ll write the\\nopening Pre Tag here And then I\\'ll write the closing pre tag here Now look what will happen That whatever is inside the Opening & closing\\nPre Tag will be displayed as they are So look \"this means that\"\\n\"svs.getfilesystemcoding() return.....\" Whatever the spaces & new lines there was You can see the them in this text And if I add more new lines here So look we are able to see a lot of new lines So If you want to that your text\\nwill render as it is So you can use Pre Tags Pre Tags are used to add codes\\nIf you want to render your code on HTML websites So use Pre Tags So that your new lines will\\npreserve as they are So this was chapter-2\\nI hope you\\'ve understood these basic tags IN the upcoming chapters we\\'ll learn\\nsome more HTM L tags But before that let\\'s do some\\npractice of chapter-2 Let\\'s move on to chapter-2 practice set So guys we are now here to solve\\nthe practice set of chapter-2 And I\\'m going to open the PDF of chapter-2 And I\\'ve also opened the chapter-2\\'s PDF It doesn\\'t matter We\\'ve learned a lot of things We learned about Big, Small, Pre,\\nSubscript & Superscript Tags And I think it was fun because we\\'ve\\nlearned how to build a website Now what we\\'ll do is, we\\'ll do some questions\\nso that you can hold tight on to the HTML And you can understand better about whatever\\nthe tags, properties & attribute we\\'ve learned So the first question is,\\n\"Create an HTML page with a heading\" Which is going to be the Title of the page\\nand yes not this Title But the title heading, there\\'s a heading\\nwhich is the Title of the whole page And then there\\'s a primary heading\\nand a sub heading So what I\\'ll do is... I\\'ll open this same folder in the VScode\\nbecause this is the chapter-2\\'s practice set I\\'ll create a file here with a name\\n\"Chater_2_practice_set\" or \"Practice_set.html\" I\\'ll add boiler plate code And I\\'ll name it \"Chapter\\n2 practice set\" And in the body I\\'m going to add the code from\\nwhich we are going to solve this question So if I want to add a primary heading\\nso it definitely will be H1 And let\\'s suppose I\\'m writing about the mountains And after that.... let us say, I\\'m adding\\nthe secondary heading and I\\'m writing \"Why mountains\" And let us say I\\'ve written a paragraph Which contains 45 words And I\\'ll turn on the Word Wrap I\\'ve told you how to turn on the word wrap So that the text will be displayed without any scroll bar So Line #12 which might not fit in one line\\nis displayed like this This is the single line\\nbut it is presented in this way And here is the line #13\\nThis is possible because of Word wrap And after \"Why Mountain?\" I\\'m going\\nto add a sub heading in it And...... The main reason Let\\'s suppose we are writing the main reasons And the Paragraph And Let\\'s suppose we\\'ve written\\n45 words in the main reasons So when I\\'ll open my page in Live Server\\nso this is what it\\'ll look like So there\\'s a page heading and\\nthere\\'s \"Why Mountains\" And then there\\'s a sub heading\\n\"The main reasons\" so we had to this We had to create an HTML page with a heading Which is going to contain the Title Heading,\\nPrimary Heading & The Sub Heading\" What tags have you used in it? Was I able to use the any other tag?\\nYes definitely I was able And when you\\'ll learn the CSS then you\\'ll know\\nhow many options you have to solve this question And when you\\'ll learn the CSS you\\'ll find that\\nyou can change the size of any element And when you can do that so sometimes you\\nbecome too greedy to use the easy tags Just like changing the font & paragraph So I don\\'t want you to be trapped in the greed I know you\\'ll get an intuitive feeling that\\nlet\\'s finish this in an easy way But in actual will that page be read by any robot? Will that page be an SEO friendly? You must ask these type of questions from\\nyourselves when you do that \"Create a page with 5 wallpaper images\\ntaken from the internet\" You have to take 5 wallpapers from the internet And you have to display them And if I search for wallpaper Then to the Images\\nand if you only want to display them So you can find a lot of wallpaper images Look we\\'ve got a lot of wallpaper images So you can use any wallpaper from this\\nit doesn\\'t matter which wallpaper you\\'ll use If I use this wallpaper\\nI\\'ll do right click > Open image in new tab And I\\'ll copy the URL of this\\nimage and take this So you just have to choose any wallpaper\\nfrom these wallpaper & you have to display it And you have to solve this question on your own I\\'m not going to solve this The reason is... You should have knowledge about how to do this Because I already have shown many examples And the third question is to \"Use BR & HR tags\\nto display a piece of text with line bricks\" Try this question too on your own because\\nI want to keep this video short & to the point That\\'s why I\\'ve given questions for the practice So that you can do practice on your own The forth question is\\n\"try the following equation using HTML\" You\\'ve to write this equation from HTML\\n(  C  +  O₂  ➜  CO₂  ) This is the equation of carbon oxidization So we\\'ll write this Let me tell you how you can write this in a paragraph You can write it  ( C  +  O2 ➜  CO2 )\\nIf you write it like this So this is how it\\'ll be displayed\\nlet me show you Something like this and which\\nis not looking good I need subscript tags So I\\'ll select it and then I\\'ll write here\\nSub and then 2 I\\'ll remove this space, and similarly I\\'ll use the sub\\ntag here and then I\\'ll write 2 and I\\'ll remove this space Now look... The equation is now displayed correctly\\n(  C  +  O₂  ➜  CO₂  ) So this reaction is looking quite correctly So ideally you want that your reaction\\nwill look like this So I want to tell you one more thing Now if we have talked about the chemical\\nreaction so let me tell you You can.. Take the arrow of the HTML from the internet So let me show you how you can\\ndisplay these type of arrows So look they have given a lot\\nof codes of HTML So if you use \"m%rarr\" so you can use\\nthe arrow symbol of HTML So we have a lot of social\\nsymbols of this type Which you can use in HTML Let me show you one use of\\nthis type of arrow So look this is how this arrow looks\\nand you can use these type of arrows in HTML And there are a lot of symbols in HTML which you can use And the codes for those symbols\\nare also given here So I hope you\\'ve understood this So if you ever want to use these type of arrows so you can search\\non internet that is HTML provide these type of symbols or not In my case it was providing\\nand I got the right arrow symbol in HTML That\\'s why I use that So I hope you\\'ve understood how to do this \"Try write a Wikipedia article using HTML\" And I want you to solve this question on your own Let us say I want to open the Wikipedia\\npage of Programming And I want to replicate this page What type of tags will you use? Let\\'s guess what tag will it be This is definitely a heading tag You can inspect it and it will be the H1 tag This is the primary heading of this\\npage so this will be H1 tag Let\\'s suppose if you won\\'t find\\nthis H1 in any page So the developer of that page\\nhas made a mistake Because if you haven\\'t use the heading tag\\neven in your heading So there\\'s something wrong with your page Your page can be displayed using the CSS\\nwithout using the heading tags But it\\'ll not be called best practice You have to do this with a good practice If you use best software techniques for building\\nwebsite or apps then you\\'ll get advantages I just want to tell you this Now I\\'ll close this because our chapter-2\\npractice set has been completed I\\'ve also hand picked some question so that you can\\ndo your practice after completing the chapter-2 I just want to keep these notes as if you have these\\nnotes & this video Then whenever you\\'ll turn the page\\nyou\\'ll remember everything And I also have given practice so that if you ever have\\nto do revision then you just have to turn some pages Now we\\'ll move to the chapter-3 And in chapter-3 we\\'ll learn\\nhow we can structure a website Because if you learn how to structure a website\\nthen you can easily create any type of website Yes I know our website is not looking that\\ngood because we haven\\'t used the CSS But if we learn how to structure our website So it\\'ll be a good win for us Let\\'s move to the chapter-3 now So let\\'s quickly open the PDF of chapter-3 And after opening the PDF we\\'ll learn\\nhow to create a page layout So chapter-3 is about creating a page layout And I\\'ve written something here and\\nthey have a very deep meaning And that\\'s why I will focus on that And I\\'ve written very minimal amount of notes And I\\'ll close the rest of the tabs When we use the right tag in a right place\\nthis help us to create a better page layout And it also help for the better indexing\\nthrough search engines And it also provides better user experience And I\\'ve used the word \"Better\" here because\\nwhat is the meaning of better? \"More satisfactory\" The work will be more satisfactory Look if you won\\'t use the right tags\\nand create the website But will the search engines be able to index it? Will your website appear on Google? Will your user get a good experience? What is the meaning of user experience? Let\\'s suppose if you install the third party\\nJavaScript Library Or if you use third-party CSS frame work It is possible that they have targeted\\nsome particular tags Like header or footer And you\\'re not using that layout So maybe you\\'ll face problems\\nwhile using that library That\\'s why I\\'m suggesting\\nbetter user experience So now we\\'ll learn how to create\\na layout of a website Ideally your website will contain a header\\nand then a main tag and a footer So now if I quickly show you\\nthis page in VScode And then if I create an \"index.html\" So look.... I\\'ll..... What shall I call it?\\nIt is called Boiler Plate Code Boiler Plate Code of HTML will appear here And I\\'ll create it with a name \"Chapter-3\" Now what I\\'ll do is...\\nAs I\\'ve told you about a header tag I\\'ve used a header tag here and then\\nI\\'ll use a main tag here And then I\\'ll add a paragraph here and\\nI\\'ll write \"This is the main content\" And after pressing ( Ctrl + Enter ) I\\'ll move downward and after \"Main\"\\nI\\'ll create a footer with And as you\\'ll create these tags VScode will completely support you By \"support\" I means that whenever you\\'ll\\nwrite something it\\'ll auto-complete it If you put you arrow won any particular tag so it\\'ll\\nprovide you a link for mdn reference So it\\'ll become very easy for you to understand things\\nand to do to the reference of a particular tag So look I haven\\'t added anything in the header For now I\\'ll write \"this is header\" And in footer I\\'ll write \"This is footer\" I\\'ll save it & open it with Live Server\\nand my website will open in Live Server And as you can see \"This header\"\\n\"This is the main content\" &  \"This is footer\" And many of you might think that\\n\"What was the need to do this? \" I can directly do this by added Paragraphs A human can know that how this\\nwebsite is structured But a robot won\\'t be able to see this It can only see this And how will it know that what is main content,\\nheader & footer of your website? Footer & Header is not that important \\nas the main content SO you have to add the main content of your\\nwebsite in between these 2 tags With that it\\'ll become easy for you to read\\n& for the search engines also And you also want that search engines can easily\\nunderstand the content of your website Why that? Because you want that traffic\\nmust hit your website If you\\'re a blogger or you provide any type of service\\nso you want the traffic on your website And you want the people to come on your\\nwebsite & appreciate your hard work So we have learned about the se index and\\nnow we\\'ll move back to the chapter-3 notes And we\\'ll learn how to use these 3 tags So we add navigation bar in the header\\nand we add Nav Tag in it And in in main tags we add\\n\"Section\" Article\" & \"Aside\" tag And these three tags are most\\ncommonly used tags You can add \"div\" here\\nwe\\'ll learn more about \"div\" later But these 3 are the most important tags\\nwhich you must have knowledge about These are the opening & closing\\ntags of main tag Basically we\\'ve talked about Header,\\nFooter & Main tag And now we\\'re diving deep in the Main Tag We\\'re trying to understand what should Main Tag contain\\nbut I\\'ve added paragraph in the Main Tag But in actual what should the Main Tag contain I\\'ll comment this out because I added this\\nparagraph just to show you I\\'ll create a section in Main Tag And what \\'Sections\\' mean? Let me explain the meaning of section When you create a section tag it means you want to\\ndisplay a particular part of your page to users When you write an article it might have been that\\nyou\\'ve written a particular thing in your page So there you can use the article tag What type of content you\\'ll add in \\'Aside\\' ? In \\'Aside\\' you\\'ll add topic which is\\ncompletely different from your main page For eg. If you\\'re using Google Ads or Facebook Ads So there you can add....\\nYou might have seen Ads on websites So if you want to show ads on your website\\nthen you can use the \\'Aside\\' Tag And then comes the closing tag of Main Tag If you follow the layout which I told you\\nso your page will be SEO friendly The user experience in your\\npage will boost up I already have told you the benefits\\nof following this layout So whenever you\\'re creating a serious website This website not a serious one\\nI\\'m just creating it to teach you If you\\'re creating a web-page for college fest or to collect information\\nabout your classmates or a group of your company If you\\'re doing stuff like this then\\nit is not a serious website But if you\\'re starting a Blog and you want\\nto generate your living from that Then that\\'s a serious business So then you have to structure\\nyour website in this way If you\\'re creating an E-Commerce website\\nlike Flipkart or Amazon Or you\\'re creating a social\\nnetwork like Facebook So it becomes mandatory for you\\nto use the tags properly I wanted to write the \"Amazon\"\\nand after writing \"ama\" suggested me If you want websites like this so you want the\\nsearch engines to understand your website So I\\'ve written\\n\"creating a page like this is not necessary\" But it creates a readable &\\nstructured layout Just like I\\'ve shown you And these type of pages are also SEO friendly Because when the computer is able to\\nunderstand your page Look, the Google also want to index your page If you mention... Let\\'s suppose you\\'re trowing a party for the whole India And you said that whoever comes\\nI\\'ll provide the best party ever But how will the people know that\\nyou\\'re providing such part You must have to convey the\\ninformation by any means Just like that your page must contains\\nsome very obvious tags Because when the things are obvious\\nso you keep them in mind This person is throwing a party\\nits very obvious Or if you structure your page like this\\nso its obvious that it\\'s your main content And it\\'s very obvious that this is a header\\nand it contains a Nav Tag And Nav Tag contains some navigations\\nlike \"Home\" \"About\" etc So I can easily recognize that you\\'ve\\ncreated this for navigation So the robot... or the computers.... Or let us say web browser it is also a type of\\nprogram it is not a human So if it is displaying your content So the additional information you\\'ve provided Which additional information? The exact position of your header, footer\\n& main content So it can use this main information So your web browser will understand that We\\'ll now move forward & discuss\\nthe Link attributes I\\'ve told you about the links And the links are.... Let me write\\n\"href=\"https://codewithharry.com\" I want to go to the codewithharry.com And let me write \"Harry\\'s website\" here So I\\'ve written \"Harry\\'s website\" Now look \"Harry\\'s website\" is written here\\nlet me zoom it in so you can see it If you click on \"Harry\\'s website\" so you\\'ll be redirected\\nto \"Harry\\'s website\" there\\'s nothing new in it But if you add an attribute here and\\nyou write \"Target = _main\" So look by writing \"Target = _main\"\\nthis website will open in new tab So this type of attributes help you to\\nadd additional functionality So many tags provides many\\ntype of attributes And now if you click here and go\\nto its MDN reference So you\\'ll get to know more about Anchor Tag So look here is the information So whenever you want to gain more information about\\nany tag so you can visit its MDN reference And there you can ready everything\\nabout that tag If you\\'re an advance user so\\nyou\\'ll understand this But if you\\'re a beginner so don\\'t be scared They have given a little demo here so just look at it\\nor I\\'ve covered everything in notes & this video So there\\'s is, was or will be nothing\\nto be worries about And we are here to shoot all\\nthe tensions & troubles Now look I\\'ve told you about link attribute\\nhow to open in a new tab And I also have told you that we can put any content\\ninside an Anchor Tag like Images & headings For now I\\'ve just added a text But if there was an image so you can also go to the\\n\"codewithharry.com\" by clicking on that image So if I add an image here I\\'ll do one thing I had an image..... This one So if I add this image here And let us say I rename it to \"cwh.jfif\" And then if I come back here and instead\\nof this text if I add an Image Tag here If I something like this here I\\'ll write \"< img src = \"cwh.jfif \" And in Alt I\\'ll write \"Harry\\'s website\" So I\\'ll cut this And I\\'ll save it And let me add width attribute\\n\"width = 123\" And image have width & height\\nboth attributes We\\'ll talk about this soon But the point I want highlight here\\nlet me show that first So if I click on this image So look I\\'ve been redirected to\\n\"codewithharry.com\" So it doesn\\'t matter if there\\'s an image or a text\\nyou\\'ll be redirected to the website in a new tab I hope that this was easy Now if I also add height here Let me take you to the note\\nI\\'ve written something \"If the page is inside the directory we need to make\\nsure that we link to the correct page\" And I\\'ll tell you about this And I\\'ll also tell you about the image So these are the 2 things which we\\'ll discuss So first let\\'s understand the Directory Or let me first mention about the height of\\nthe image which is very important If you set both width & height of an image Let\\'s suppose if I make it\\'s height 34 So it\\'s aspect ratio will be disturbed\\nnow what is aspect ratio? Let me show you This is the image with a disturbed aspect ratio Which means if you\\'ve created a website with a landscape image And the if you take that image in portrait mode with your phone And then you try to show that image \\nin a landscape mode So it is possible that your image\\'s\\naspect ratio will disturb So to avoid this we only set one\\nThe Height or The Width And then the second attribute\\nis set automatically So if I only set the height so it\\'ll keep the\\nheight 34 and the set the width automatically Such that the aspect ration of this\\nimage won\\'t be disturbed You read online more about aspect ratio And...... Aspect ratio You can read about aspect ratio I hope 90% of you have understood this But if you\\'re in that 10% who don\\'t\\nunderstand aspect ratio Just Google it, don\\'t think that you\\'re dumb Everyone is weak at something It is better to gain knowledge about them ASAP Now we\\'ll move forward to the next one\\nwhich I\\'ve written here If a page is inside a directory we need to make sure\\nthat the link we are using is for the correct page\" What do I mean by this? As I\\'ve used this \"cwh.jfif\" Let\\'s suppose this is inside a\\nfolder with name \"IMG\" Suppose I\\'ve moved all my images\\nto the IMG folder Let us say I\\'m using 100 images\\nin this particular website And I don\\'t want a bundles of images\\nhere in my directory So I\\'ll pack all the images\\nin the IMG folder But there will be a problem This is saying that\\n\"This is image doesn\\'t exist\" Now if you inspect it then you\\'ll be\\nable to see \"Failed to load\" Which means you tried to use the \"cwh.jfif\" But we couldn\\'t find that Why so? Because \"cwh.jfif\" is not here now It is in the IMG folder\\nso this is how yo have to add its URL \"IMG/cwh.jfif\"\\nwhich means in the IMG folder BTW you can name this folder of your choice\\nit\\'s not mandatory to name it \"IMG\" You can also name it \"Harry\" IO just named it \"IMG\" because I can\\neasily recognize that it contains images And this error will be fixed So there\\'s nothing to be worried about I just wanted to tell you because this is mostly\\nused when you\\'ll use frame work ...If you use Flask, Django, Angular or View You\\'ll have to face these things At the end of the day all these frame\\nwork renders HTML So we\\'ve learned this and this and we\\'ve learned\\nthat we can use IMG tag in Anchor tag And we\\'ve leaned that we can set only one attribute from the Height\\n& the Width and the second one will be set automatically And we also have learned that we can use any one]\\nfrom the Single(\\'_\\') or Double Quote(\"_\") Because it increase the consistency And you don\\'t want the other developers\\nto remember you in bad terms You want them to remember you in good terms And you want to write a good code\\nwith the easiest way And if you\\'re maintaining the code on your own\\nthen it increase a reason to maintain it correctly Now we\\'ll talk about \\'Div\\' and \\'Div\\' tag used\\nas a container for other elements What does it mean? We use \\'Div\\' as a container Sometimes we have to add some\\ntags in a container For eg. Let us say I have to pack a Paragraph\\nand a Heading in a particular section Let\\'s suppose I\\'m creating another section and\\nI\\'ve to add different Heading & Paragraph Let\\'s suppose I\\'ve to choose H1 and\\nI\\'ll write \"Why Love HTML\" And then I\\'ll write a paragraph here I\\'ll write \"HTML is a quite good language and\\nit has turned my life upside-down\" I\\'ll write something like this and any HTML\\ndeveloper who loves HTML will write this And then I\\'ll write H1 \"Why use Boot Starp\" Let\\'s suppose I write \"Why use Boot Starp\"\\nhere and then if I write \"Lorem12\" So I want to keep them separated It is possible that with the CSS..... What does \\'Div\\' means? It means we\\'ve divided this set of\\nHeading & Paragraph So I\\'ve divided this set of heading & paragraph This one is different and\\nthis one is different Now if I want to increase it\\'s size then \\nI can do that with the CSS How we can increase that? If you don\\'t know CSS then\\ngive it a shot later I\\'ve made videos on CSS For now just focus on HTML And I want this div to be of red color I\\'m showing you but don\\'t think\\nthat you can\\'t do that I\\'ll save this page and the changes\\nwill reflect automatically And let me reset it with (Ctrl + scroll) Now let\\'s suppose I want to change\\nthe BG of this \\'Div\\' to \\'Red\\' How am I doing this? You don\\'t have to be\\nworried about I\\'m just adding the CSS Just to show you how you can change\\nthe BG of a particular \\'Div\\' I\\'ve change a particular \\'Div\\' BG to \\'Purple\\'\\nand another \\'Div\\' to \\'Red\\' So this is how I can add styles and to\\nadd styles I\\'ve divided them These 2 are together and\\nThese 2 are together Now we\\'ll talk about the In-Line\\n& Block elements What is In-line element? and\\nwhat is Block element? In-line element is the element which\\noccupies space according to it\\'s need For eg. if I want to put this SD card somewhere So it\\'ll occupy space as per it needs And I can also put a mouse by it And I can put this pen by it too I can everything side by side But let\\'s suppose if there was a rule that you cannot\\nput SD card and other things in a same line This is the Block element Let me explain what I mean If I write a \\'Div\\' here. Let me show you a \\'Div\\'\\nand then I\\'ll show you a \\'Span\\' \\'Div\\' is a container and \\'Span\\' is also a container\\nI\\'ll write \"I\\'m a span tag here\" here And then I\\'ll create another \\'Span\\'\\nand in that I\\'ll write \"I\\'m another span\" Now see the difference between them Now I\\'ll inspect it and I already have told you\\nthat you can inspect by doing right click Now I\\'ll click on this arrow Now see my \\'Div\\' tag... This is the Paragraph but\\nI\\'ll go to my \\'Div\\' tag The \\'Div\\' tag was inside the main tag\\nI\\'ve added that in section Look how much this \\'Div\\' should\\noccupy space? Only this much But it is occupying the whole space So \\'Div\\' element or \\'Div\\' like other element wherever\\nthey step-in the whole space belongs to them And \\'Span\\' is a like an innocent boy It only focus on it\\'s job And \\'Span\\' only occupy the space it needs I\\'ll remove the Paragraph from here\\nbecause it is a Block element And I\\'ll only keep the \\'Span\\' Paragraph is a block element & \\'Span\\'\\nis an in-line element So \\'Span\\' will only occupy the space it needs You can see as I keep arrow on\\nit so it is highlighting \\'Span\\' is only occupying this much space\\nand there\\'s another \\'Span\\' by it Because \\'Span\\' is like an innocent boy Which means it is an In-line element \"In-line\" contains 2 words \"In\" & \"Line\"\\nwhich means ins a single line So it is an In-line element\\nand I\\'ll mention here \" \\'Span\\' is an example of an In-line element \" And obviously I\\'ll comment this out And then I\\'ll write \" \\'Div\\' is an example of a Block element \" I\\'ll comment this out too And look I\\'m using \" Ctrl + / ) for commenting out It is a very simple shortcut So we have now learned In-line\\n& Block element So in chapter-3 we learned that there are\\n2 types of container \\'Div\\' & \\'Span\\' \\'Div\\' is an In-line element & \\'Span\\' is a\\nblock element I\\'ve written this for you \\'Div\\' tag is often used as a container\\nfor other elements \\'Div\\' is a block level element\\n\\'Span\\' is an In-line container Which means it only occupies space it needs So we\\'ve learned that \\'Span\\' tag is an In-line\\ncontainer and \\'Div is a Block level element Block element means it occupies\\nspace more than it needs And In-line element means it only\\noccupies space which is necessary You have to remember one thing if you add a block\\nlevel container in an In-line container So the block level container will\\noccupy the whole space So that\\'s why I didn\\'t add Paragraph in \\'Span\\' and I added\\nonly text or you can also add any other In-line tag So guys as you can see I\\'ve provided the\\nlist of In-line & Block elements Whatever we\\'ll name these form elements After going to the backend\\npay close attention on my words So guys this is the time for us to discuss\\nthe search engine optimization In chapter-5 I\\'ve explained\\nbriefly about the SEO And if you\\'re a web developer then you must\\nwant to learn SEO at any point of time Let me tell you what I\\'ve learned\\nabout SEO in my life I\\'ll tell you in very short term\\nbut it\\'ll be very effective In my opinion using SEO with-in\\na limit is good But SEO is not about using is a website like... Let me show you which type of\\nwebsite I\\'m talking about It\\'s not like if I open this website\\nin a Live Server If you search for videos on Google If I search videos on Google So this website will never\\npop-up on the top Now matter how much SEO I\\'ve done What\\'s the reason for that?\\nRelevance Let\\'s suppose you\\'re Google And you have to rank the websites So if you have to rank the website\\nthen what would you do? If you have to rank the website then you\\'ll\\ncurate the best websites And you want to show the website which\\nis best suitable with the keyword Let\\'s assume that YouTube Community not \\nused the Search Engine Optimization And on the internet you search\\nfor \"YouTube\" So what do you think if you have created a website like\\nYouTube & done the SEO without providing any value Do you think that your website will pop-up on\\nthe top while searching for the YouTube Definitely not So Search Engine Optimization is a way to\\nimprove the existing ranking a lil-bit Pay close attention I\\'ll rather say SEO is the way to\\nhelp Search Engine finding your website So at maximum you can just specify the Google\\nabout your website & it\\'s content If you\\'ve made an excellent website on internet and then\\nyou think that your website will pop-up on the top And you\\'ve also written a good content So the search engines like Google, Bing & Yahoo also\\nask about your website, its content & description Like \"Codewithharry.com\" is a website This website is about who? If someone search for \"Fires\" So this description is most important for the\\nuser who is searching for the fire So Search Engines always ask you about\\nthe description like this one So it\\'ll be easy for us to show this page And if you tell about the Title so it\\'ll be easy\\nfor us to show your page title here And the users will be valued who are coming to\\nsearch website on the Search Engines So the very first thing for the SEO is...\\nIn my opinion it didn\\'t even include in course SEO To provide the value In actual how much useful is your content? If a website is actually useful\\nI\\'ll show you If I search for \"Bill Gates Blog\" So do you think this search is\\noptimized properly? Yes the optimization has taken place But if a blog is related to a\\nparticular person You may have seen some websites in which\\npeople make a very basic page in HTML After all that those website\\npop-up on the top Reason being \"Relevance\" because those website contains\\nthe content which user actually searched for I won\\'t explain more about SEO I only have included SEO in chapter-5 that is necessary\\nfor you to learn if you\\'re learning the HTML We\\'ll focus only on HTML stand point of SEO We won\\'t dive to depth of the SEO\\nbecause it includes a lot of things We will not be looking in to keyword building\\nin content optimization aspect of SEO How we do keyword building? How we\\ndo content optimization Writing content according to \"which content is being\\nsearch for how many time\" this also comes under SEO But... We won\\'t focus on that aspect We\\'ll look for the existing which\\nalready have written How to add SEO in that page How can we improve the ranking of that website\\nby adding more HTML tags & optimization And not by any illegal means We\\'ll actually provide value to our users And how will we do that? We\\'ll shorten it\\'s loading time. If a page is taking 10 sec\\nto be load that, Google might not show that on the top And on the other if a page is taking\\nfraction of a sec to load Definitely Google will show that on the top Now let\\'s talk about types of SEOs\\nWe\\'ve got 2 types of SEOs The first one is the On-page SEO\\nand the second one is the Off-page SEO We\\'ll talk about On-page SEO which\\ncan be done by HTML developers And what does Off-page SEO means? Off-page SEO means you\\'ve\\nto do link building Many people says there\\'s no\\nadvantage of link building Let me tell you the meaning if Link Building If another website is linked to your website For eg. if I point on a website Let\\'s suppose if I\\'ve added a URL\\nof my Facebook page So there are many people who\\nare pointing on Facebook So search engines will recognize that many people are pointing\\non this website so it must contain something important So this is called link building This comes under Off-page but I\\'ll only talk about\\nOn-page which can be done by HTMl developers And in On-page SEO you can\\ndo SEO through HTML HTML developer can implement SEO\\nusing following techniques We\\'ll talk about some techniques And again this not a \\ncomprehensive right to SEO Which means it\\'s not like if you learn this then you\\'ve completed SEO I\\'ll make a course for SEO in future But I just wanted to add a chapter in which\\nyou can know that how to so SEO The first technique I want to tell you is\\n\"it is set the title very nice & to the point\" Add a very nice & to the point title And then set a meta description Add a description meta tag And why should we have to add a nice title? Because title is the main thing\\nwhich is shown in the search If you come across a good title so there\\'s high\\nchances that you\\'ll click on that Because the very step is to\\nClick on to the website And if you\\'ll only read the content\\nwhen you\\'ll find it useful If you don\\'t click on the website and your website\\ndoesn\\'t have CTR (Click through rate) So what\\'s the use for that? So that\\'s why the click is important Now this website is taking too long to load or there\\'s\\nsomething wrong with my internet If there\\'s some problem in site\\nthen this site might be loosing on.... ...You know... ...On traffic Because it is working too slow Look this website has been loaded Let\\'s have a look on another page This is also loaded Look this website is not working But now this works Sometimes when website gets slow\\nso they stop working So Google remove them from the first page This type of pop-ups are also not a good\\nsigns for good user experience But again people create this because\\nthey get the incentive Anyways... we won\\'t talk about them much Meta description sets the Meta description Meta description means that you have\\nto add a meta tag Let me tell you how to add Meta Tag\\nand let\\'s open this folder in VScode And obviously I\\'ll close the other folder And I\\'ll make a file with\\nthe name \"seo.html\" And obviously I\\'ll add a\\nboiler plate code in it And here I\\'ll write \"S-E-O\" And then let\\'s say I\\'ll add a Header here And then I\\'ll add a Nav Tag And then I\\'ll add \"UL\" and then \"LI\" and\\nthen I\\'ll write \"Home\" in it And similarly I\\'ll add \"About\" after \"Home\" And let\\'s say this is how\\nI\\'m creating my website \"About\"...... And after \"About\"\\nI\\'ll write \"Contact\" So a basic website always contains\\n\"Home\" \"About\" \"Contact\" Now let\\'s say I\\'m adding a \\'Section\\' in its Main Content\\n& after that let\\'s say I\\'m adding a \\'Div\\' in it And I\\'m adding a paragraph in a container in which I\\'ve added \"Lorem34\" Which I\\'ve added some sample text\\nand let me show you this website in Live Server And this is our website And I\\'ll close all these links And look this is how my website is looking Now let us say that I want to add\\nMeta Tag in this website Look I already have added the Title Now if I only add SEO in it Let us say I\\'m talking about SEO\\nThis is not at all an appropriate Title Because if you\\'re talking about the SEO\\nthen write this in this way \"SEO: A beginner\\'s guide\" SEO in 2021: A beginner\\'s guide \"SEO in 2022: A beginners guide\" So if someone search for\\n\"How will SEO change in 2021\" And your article is providing information for that content\\nso there\\'s high chance that the user will click on that So your page must contain very click-able title\\n& the content related to your title This page doesn\\'t contain anything about SEO I\\'m just taking an example & it\\'s not like that you can\\nwrite anything and your page will pop on the top I\\'ve written this & now we\\'ll add Meta Tag here Now look there\\'s already a\\nMeta Tag for \"View Port\" I\\'ll write \"Meta\" & then \"desc\" and\\nthen I\\'ll write about SEO SEO is like... Suppose I\\'ll write anything ...This is a nice article on SEO I know that I\\'ve written this for no reason But you can write good content\\nin 80-100 words And if you\\'ve written more then\\nGoogle will chop it off There\\'s nothing to be worried about if you\\'ve\\nwritten SEO which is a very competitive As you can see \"Seo stands for....\"\\nThey must have added this in their Meta Tag Now look, if I open this website then there\\'s high chance\\nthat they must have added Met Description And you can see that they have added Meta Tag for description We\\'ve got a lot of types of Meta Tags But you must set the meta\\ntag for description There\\'s no guarantee about your\\ncontent displaying here as is it Google will use your Meta Description\\nonly when it\\'ll find it usable I\\'m telling you this with my experience, I\\'ve noticed this\\nfrom all the websites which I build & appeared on Google Now \"Set a nice URL slug\" What does this mean? Look, whenever you\\'re working with a backend Let\\'s suppose if you\\'re using Flask, Django or PHP\\nso you must name your page that So when someone look at it...\\nJust as they have given \"seo\" You have to name it in a way that if someone share your URL\\nthen the receiver can easily recognize what is contains If I give you an URL\\n\"boss.com/learn/seo/this\" What will be your reaction? You\\'ll ask what it is? You\\'ll say \"Yes! This may contain information about SEO\" But what information about SEO? But if I give you a URL \"What-is-SEO\" \"What-is-SEO\" So you\\'ll say \" Yes ! they have mentioned about SEO in URL\" There\\'s 99% chance that this URL is telling\\nus more about \"What is SEO\" So we\\'ll need a good slug\\na URL Slug is like \"what-is-seo\" So we\\'ll name a goof URL slug that anyone can tell what\\ndoes this URL contains just by looking at that So if Google or any other search engine\\nwill index your page so it\\'ll tell That \"Yes! If this man has set it\\'s slug nicely\\nso it definitely want to help the people\" This man is not here to earn Google ranking\\nbut to help the people for real So Google notices this And we\\'ve done \"Set the Meta description\"\\n& \"Set the nice URL slug\" Now add the meta tag for keywords Many people don\\'t add the\\nMeta Tag for keywords You can either do or don\\'t but it depends Many people says that the Meta Tag of\\nkeywords is treated as a \\'Span\\' But this is how you can dd Keyword\\'s Meta Tag And I\\'ve told you I\\'ll write\\n\"Meta name = keyword\" And then \" content = seo, search, seo 2021 \" So this is how you can set keywords But many people says that this\\npractice is not good enough This increase the \\'Spam\\' and people\\nmake the keywords tough So this is how you can add meta tag for keywords So in actual people have abused this\\n\"meta name = keywords\" more than using it And people started adding more than\\nenough keywords in their pages Which was an unfair practice So the search engines started discouraging this And they have decided not to use\\n\"meta name = keyword\" at all So this came to light and there\\'s no\\nmdn link for \"meta name = keywords\" If you hover on it then you\\'ll\\nfind no mdn link You\\'ll find for meta element but not for\\n\"meta name = keywords\" And this is reason that even mdn\\ncommunity has denied this So I wanted to tell you this about\\nkeyword description So do not set the meta keyword tags Because people have abused that and even\\nif you add sweet keyboard stag If you add a small tag with 2-3 keyword\\nthen it is not a problem in my opinion So the next point is to set\\nthe meta author tag And we have to set the meta author tag because if you are writing\\na blog then you must want to mention about the author And your users will also want to know about the author because maybe\\nthey are interested in reading the content of their favourite author And then we\\'ll move to \"set a fav icon\"\\nand let me tell you what is fav icon I\\'ll visit the \"fav icon generator\" And look they are telling how you\\ncan make your fav icon Suppose that I\\'m visiting this website &\\nI\\'ve downloaded a fav icon So after downloading I\\'ll unzip it &\\nI\\'ll do \"extract to fav icon\" And you can see it has given me some icons\\nand I can use them as a fav icon So I\\'ll copy \"favicon.ico\" file And after copying I want to use it here So I\\'ll open this folder And I\\'ll write \"Reveal in file explorer\" And I\\'ll paste it here And then I\\'ll go to \"link fav icon\"\\nand I\\'ll write \"favicon.icon\" Now my icon would appear here when\\nI press (Ctrl + Shift + R) So look my fav icon has appeared here So this is called fav icon You can use this website or any other\\nwebsite thee are a lot of them Which helps you to create fav icon Now look they have provided different\\noptions like BG color Now I want to add some padding here because I\\nthink the text is quite close with the boundaries But again you can use another fav icon and for that you\\ncan use fav icon generator or Adobe Photo Shop That\\'s up to you. But once you got the \\'.ico file\\'\\nso this is how yo can set it So I hope you got the point And there were an error in my pages\\nthat the fav icon wasn\\'t appearing But that error has been fixed now So if you set the fav icon in this way then it\\'ll provide a good user\\nexperience and user will find that he is on a genuine website Which is good Now the next point is\\n\"Compress images & other resources\" If you write image compressor So you\\'ll find some image compressing website on internet\\nin which you can upload your image and compress them Which means you can lower their size without\\nhaving to lose a lot of quality Your image quality does get low\\nwhen you compress them But there are some compressions which can give you\\ngreat compression by decreasing minimum quality It is possible that your 25 MB image may turn to 2 MB\\nand you don\\'t have to pay a lot of loss in quality Now let\\'s suppose if you\\'re displaying your\\n100 MB image in just this small portion So there\\'s no point in that and there are high\\nchances that you can optimize it So you have to use things like this So upload your files on it and\\ndownload the compressed file and use them And then there comes \"Minify & compress\" You can minify & compress all of these\\nJavaScript, CSS & HTML And there are a lot of tools Look here\\'s a website That you can upload your\\nJS or CSS file here And it\\'ll minimize in actual\\nso I\\'ll write a sample CSS I\\'ll write.... \"background:red\" and\\nthen I\\'ll close it in this way And when I\\'ll minify it so look it has removed\\nall the spaces & new lines If a bigger CSS files contains a lot of spaces so size of\\nthat file will increase and this website remove all of them And when we write HTML or\\nCSS code in this format We add more spaces & new lines because\\nwe have to increase the readability We do the format document to increase the readability so\\nthat when we or our fellow programmer read this code Or tries to improve this code So he won\\'t find this code difficult\\nto read & rubbish So we want to avoid these type of things But when computer read this file\\nso you can give a compressed file Which means you can remove these\\nnew lines & extra spaces So this is what these tools does\\nso you have to minify your HTML, CSS & JS file So you\\'ll find a boost in SEO\\nand your\\nload time will also decrease Because you were loading the file of 100 MB at that\\ntime and now you\\'re loading the file of just 2 MB So definitely your load time\\nwill decrease So compressing the image decrease\\nyour load time And the benefit of minifying & compressing the HTML, CSS\\n& JS files is that you\\'re not downloading the extra files And after this \"Add alt text to images\" I\\'ve told yo about an alt attribute in which if an image\\nis failed to load so a text will be displayed And it\\'s a good practice because if your image\\nfailed to load then you\\'ll will see an alt text And if it also help the blind peoples who\\ncome to read the content on your website So the devices read the alt text to explain\\nthem the topic of your image So I hope you got the point and\\nyou\\'ve learned the HTML I\\'ll provide all the chapter in\\na zip file as they are And also access the notes & codes And many people ask for all\\nthe chapter in 1 PDF file But you can use a tool name \"Merge tool\" But I\\'ll add a \"merge.pdf\" in which you\\'ll\\nget all the chapters merged So I\\'ll add that too I hope you\\'ve understood the HTML And in future I\\'ll upload a course for CSS with notes\\nand please do tell in the comments if you want that too And in that we\\'ll learn how to make websites We\\'ll learn to create good websites\\ntemplates and CSS I hope this video we\\'ll will teach\\nyou HTML perfectly So that\\'s it for this video guys And if you want to move ahead then you can watch my CSS playlist\\nand I\\'ve also made a lot of projects for web development I\\'ve made some advance project for web\\ndevelopment and I also have made games Using HTML, CSS and JS And I\\'ll soon upload a video for CSS\\nso you can also wait for that So I hope you\\'ve enjoyed this video an if you\\ndo then please tell me in the comments That\\'s it for this video guys\\nThank you so much guys for watching this video :)\\nAnd I\\'ll see you next time'"

       "' in this video i am  going to teach you html from very starting to the very end this video is going to be with complete own handwritten notes you just have to invest your time in this video theres no any type of pre-requisite just invest your time in this video and you will  be able to create beautiful websites many of you will think that, this video is quite  lengthy but actually this video is quite short because i have  packed my all experience in this video and i have  provided hand written notes and the source code which you can use again & again creating new websites you just have to invest your time in this course and this is absolutely free, which means you do not  have to pay anything you just have to invest your time & attention and teaching you html will be my guarantee before starting this video i want you to hit the like button and comment.... ...your name and the city you belong to doing this makes me feel good and if i ever need to interact with you then i can find your comment from my comment box it is  been a long time for me coding in html and i will  tell you what is important and what is  not there are a lot of things which people usually miss for eg. \"playing audio\" \"main tag\" \"semantic tag\" \"seo\" there are a lot of thing which people usually miss i am  going to cover all these topics in this video and i will  make you a successful + profitable html developer so that you can get a good starter and you can build good websites now i want to tell you difference between html, css & js with an analogy html is like a human skeleton and css is just like the skin on the skeleton this means it beautifies that css do the same work on html just like skin do on our skeleton our skin provides help to our skeleton to look good and css helps the html to look beautiful just like our brain impart the logic in us just like that js provides logic to website made with html + css i have  discuss briefly more about this in chapter 0 where i have  explained this with another analogy but now we will  understand the difference between the backend & frontend and how does a basic website works whenever a web browser request \"www.codewithhary.com\" from a web server so in return web server send the files of html, css and js your browser parce these html, css and js files and show you what you actually see in a website actually it was codes but your browser parce that in such a manner that a beautiful website is visible to you i have  divided this video in 5 chapters where i have  provided a practice set with each chapter so that you can practice it well i have  solved important question in that and i will  provide all the code as a zip file in this video i will  tell you how to download those codes lets get started with the introduction so guys i have  made a pdf of chapter 0 and i will  open this chapter 0 pdf here and as you can see i have  written \"chapter 0 introduction\" html = hypertext markup language and html is the language of the web it is used to create websites if you ever visited a website lets suppose \"www.codewithharry.com\" if you ever visit a website and then you go to \"view page source\" so you will  be able to see the actual source of this website you will  be able to see how this website was made what are thing which was used in frontend which type of tags they have used and now if you do not  know about html then maybe you will  find these tags over-whelming but let me tell you, i am  going to make these things very easy for you all so we have  lean about full from of html it is hypertext markup language this is the language of the web which means you will  need this ...if you want to display beautiful web pages it is used to create websites we use html tags to define look & feel of a website to define the look & feel of a website we use the html for eg. if i want a link here, so i will  specify that through an html tag and if i want an image here, so i will  need to specify that through an html tag that i need an image here and if i need text or a paragraph here so i have  to specify that through an html tag that i need a paragraph here just take page composition like a food with different kind of ingredients like a recipe for eg. in cake if you want to add chocolate or cake just like these ingredients you have to add html tags in html web page now just like you make food theres a recipe you add the ingredients accordingly it is  not like you added 10 tsp chilli powder and 20 tsp salt theres a sequence in the recipe which we have to follow just like theres a sequence of using html tags you have to add those tags accordingly now look, html stands for hypertext markup language html is the language of the web it is used to create websites we use html tags to define look & feel of the website with understanding of these tags and how to put them together, we can create beautiful websites easily we can create a very beautiful website with understanding these tags if we know how we can use these tags together so we can make very beautiful websites just like i made \"codewithhary.com\" i definitely used my html knowledge while creating it html knowledge will definitely be used while creating any type of website the biggest question people will have in their mind is \"if html is enough so why we need css & js? \" let me tell you html is only used to define your websites pages layout i repeat,to define your websites pages layout it is just a bare bone page structure you have not  added any design or style in it if you do not  use the css, let me show you how your website will look i will  only keep the html and remove the css from this so all the css style sheets.... you do not  have to learn these things i am  just showing you after removing the css style sheets and look after removing  css style sheets this is how it looks now you do not  have to learn how to remove style sheets because i am  going to teach you this but i just want to show you.... ...if i remove css style sheets so this is how it looks so now you all know why css is used for? css is used for to handle the designs and all other things i have not  ruined this website i just changed that on frontend and i will  also teach you this this was not changes on backend which means i have not  changed this for all i only changes \"codewithhary.com\" for this particular browser look, i reloaded this page and everything is in its place so this button is of green color or blue or red the sequence of the button... you can specify all this through css you specify all this through css and thats why we have added css in website now if i ask you about css? css is used to add styling in any page now if i ask you about javascript javascript is used to program log in for the page layout if you want to program logic for any page layout for eg. if we take the example of this particular website this is running through logic that at first this have to be written after that \"machine learning\" and then \"welcome to codewithharry\" i did all this with the help of javascript how can i specify that what program will run after clicking on which button? i will specify this with the help of javascript with the help of javascript we can program the logic we can specify that if a user click on this button so this will happen does page have to be reload or not? we can specify this with javascript if any user move their mouse cursor here so let us say tell him to be alert so to specify these type of things i can use javascript javascript is used in logic programming how? you will  know soon about this \"what happens when a user hovers on a text? \" when to hide or show elements? if you need to hide or show any element so you can do that with the help of javascript you can write code in javascript to hide any element let me show you a very quick example i will  move this downward for some reason i like it downwards i do not  know why you can write javascript here i will  tell you how these things actually works so i will  open my javascript console where i can write my javascript and here i will  quickly write \"document.body.style.backgroundcolor = \"red\" ; i repeat i have  written this line which says.... turn the bodys background  are d\\' and look as i press the \"enter\" as i inject the javascript, this turns  are d\\' and how to perform these things? i will  tell in chapter 1 i will  tell you, how you can do these things but for now i just want to tell you how you can control your page now many of you will think that \"bg color\" is a part of styling no, you can change the bg color through css but with javascript you can even control that with javascript you can choose to hide or show anything & for as many minutes as you like with the help of javascript we will  learn all these things and you know these things will be in their place when i will  reload the page now lets have a look on a beautiful analogy which i have  written this is a very good analogy thats why i refer it as \"beautiful\" if html is your cars body let us assume you are a car manufacturer if you are not, then just assume and now i will  search for a video on youtube which is related to car manufacturing and i have  got a video related to car manufacturing now look at these cars look at their unpainted body just take those bodies as html and now if i paint this and make some designs... add some designed lights in it tail lights, head lamps and add a good wind shield and make it like that everyone who see this will be amazed by its design for now no one will be amazed by this cars design there are cars, like sport cars you will  be amazed by their design so if you see those type of cars the first one is its frame along with that they have designed it so just like that with html you design the frame of your website and then you design it with the css so now if we forward it, i hope they have painted it & make it looks good and whatever the car it is it will  look good so look...... they have not  showed this look it is looking good now, they have painted it and done all the detailing so the conclusion is... at the first the car was like this and now this is how it looks you will  find these types of car very amazing but i just want to tell you that... css is used for styling so what is this javascript take javascript as cars engine i mean logic when to put break & at how much pressure how to change the gears what will happen after changing the gear take this as an example of javascript what will happen when the user will change the gear now suppose there is a car which looks good but its break does not  function & it is  engine is also broken so that car is also useless so this is role of html, css & js on a website the html is the frame of a website css is the decoration and javascript is the frontend logic why am i referring it as frontend logic so javascript is a type of client side logic which means the logic that user can also see and backend logic is always hidden from us the server from where this website is coming for example my website was designed in django so what logic is djangos backend is using i will never know i can only see the logic of frontend i can see it is  logic that how is it functioning so i can see all the logic of frontend if you are  too confused, then do not  be just understand that javascript program the logic that what will happen by clicking on which button in how much time the action will be taken by clicking on which button whatever the action your browser is taking for eg. if it displaying an image so i hope you have  understood this. we will  start learning how to beautiful layout in this course we will  soon learn to create beautiful layouts we will  now install the vscode now many of you will think why are we installing the vscode and what this is? and do we need to install something special to write basic html website let me answer these questions no! we do not  need to do anything fancy to create websites for eg. if i create a notepad file here if i select \"new\" --> \"text document\" and if i name it \"codewithharry.html\" you can save an html file by \".htm\" or \".html\" extension i have  made this file and it is saying you are  changing the extension from \".txt\" to \".html\" is it fine? yes it is fine i have  changed it knowingly now i will  open it with notepad i will  open it simple notepad which every computer have if you are  using a mac or linux so a basic editor is definitely shipped with each operating system so lets move here & what we will  do? we will  click right --> view page source and we will  copy this and paste it here i have  simply pasted it i am  telling you the website  will not  look 100% good because there are styles which i am  using through sever roots for now we  will not  discuss this we will  just keep in mind that it is  not this easy to view page source of any website copied it is  code and paste it in a notepad and we can copy that website, it is  not possible but maybe it is possible lets have a look, so i have  saved it i have  opened it with notepad by clicking right i will  open it with notepad by clicking right and after pasting all this text i have  saved it with \"ctrl + s\" and now i will  open this in google chrome it is copied to quite extent but not fully it is look same to quite extent to some extent we copied it but we were unable to copy it 100% look here, this is different & this is different we will  also understand its reason and we will  understand its reason briefly in the upcoming chapters but for now just remember you do not  have to download anything look the images are missing from here style sheets took some time to be downloaded it is working, but some images are missing but again if you click on a blog so it is not working so the conclusion is... you can copy the website but not 100% it is  not that easy to copy the website now if you have understanding so you can do, it is  not that difficult but it is  not that easy because... ....there are a lot of things. we will  have a look at them but for now we will  just keep in my mind that we can do coding with notepad but the biggest drawback of using notepad for coding is... that you do not  have any support through your ide or text editor what i mean to say is.. if you use a text editor like vscode or you use a fully fledged ide for eg. dream-weaver there are a lot of things in market nowadays i recommend vscode personally to everyone because in vscode yo can perform every function. i also have written this in notes let me close all these tabs we can use any text editor of our choice you can also use notepad, but using notepad while building a big website will be stupidity why? because if you are  using notepad then you have to type each & everything and if you are  using vscode so it provides some suggestions when you are typing now look, how to install vscode? you just have to open a new tab and you have to search \"download vscode\" and if you are  using mac or linux so you can download it accordingly i am  using 64-bit windows so i will  download it by clicking on 64-bit and look my vscode has started downloading it downloads very soon if you have a good internet connection and my internet speed is quite good so you just download it and after that you just simply have to open it and then you have to install it it is  as simple as that now i want to ell you a few things while installing it you have to check some options which means you will  see some boxes and you have to select them i am  waiting till it downloads and it has downloaded when we will  open & run it so look, you have  to read & accept the agreement and then click on \"next\" and you have to check some options look i have  checked them \"add \"open with code\" to windows explorer file context menu\" \"add \"open with code\" action to windows explorer directory context menu register code as an editor for supported file types \"add to path\" and i will  tell you what will happen by these and then click on \"install\" i have  already installed but i am  still installing it if you have  installed it wrong. let suppose if you forget to check those options so you run it again just like me you  will not  face any loss you  will not  lose any important file i  will not  launch it and i will  click on \"finish\" and if you follow every step and if you have installed the vscode as i told you and if you right click here so you will  find an option here \"open with code\" we command it to show this option when we were installing the vscode click on \"open with code\" and after that you will  see all the files of this directory here not here but here and you can create a new file by click here and create a new folder by clicking here if you are  using vscode for the first time then do not  be scared because you will  get used to once you use it and then you have to click on \" + \" sign and...... you can create any file for eg. \"this.txt\" and you can write anything here this is some content on this file save it and after this you have to click here in you extension tab and after that you have to install an extension which is \"live server\" now many of you are using this very first time and you do not  have any idea about \"live server\" just install this \"live server\" \"installing....\" and it is now installed now as you can see \"live server\" has been installed and i can open any file with \"live server\" let me show you the file we created \"cwh.html\" if i right click on this file and click on \"open with live server\" look i will  click on this & it is asking me something and i will  cancel it and after this look, it will  create a live server for me it creates a server like a website and then display all the files you can open it directly with double click on these files but this method is recommended because this creates a web server for you and if you are using web server so the advantage of using a web server is... your files will actually be served through server when you will  host your website if you serve your files through a web server from the very beginning so everything will be identical and this method is highly recommended in comparison to this method so i will  close this & this and i hope you have  installed the vscode we can use any text editor of our choice once again let me tell you here i am  using vscode because it is lightweight open-source from microsoft you just simply have to visit the google and search \"vscode\" just install it like me you can write html even in notepad text-editors like vscode just make these things easier we will  see how vscode make these things easier i will  make this \"cwh.html\" file, a blank file let me show you how vscode facilitate in a great we-development if you add an \"exclamation mark\" (!) and then press \"enter\" then you will  get this template automatically so this was a very small thing to notice and if you press \"alt + ↑\" so look you can move this you can move all these things in fact you can move this line upward & downward if you can perform all these actions so you can definitely become a fast web-developer compare to if you do coding in notepad nobody codes in notepad we use vscode for these kind of features for example \"live server\"... ...and to be able to move this line to duplicate the line to use all these features and to set the keyboard shortcuts we use vscode i can zoom it by pressing \"ctrl\" and scroll my scroll wheel if i go to \"settings\" and then turn on this setting so you can zoom it by using your mouse wheel if i check this setting so i can zoom it like this so to learn all these things we use vscode or i will  say to enjoy these features we use vscode because we got a lot of things in vscode and theres nothing in notepad to change the font size you have to press a lot keys so thats why we  will not  use notepad but we can definitely use notepad we just have to understand how to do things now we will  move to the chapter-1 where we will  create our first website we will  learn different kind of things and learn about \"index.html\" and we will  learn about we page structure what is a basic web page structure lets move to chapter-1 now so guys we will  now move to chapter-1 firstly we will  open this and the chapter-1 is \"creating pour first website\" which will tell us how we can create our website so before starting this let me tell you that every website is made up of html and we start building a website by creating a file named \"index.html\" so i will  open my vscode and my vscode is opened in this folder in which folder? \"html0\" i want to open vscode instead of this folder but in this folder because that was the chapter-0 and the work i done in chapter-0 was in this directory and i want the work of chapter-1 to be done here so i will  do right click here and then click on \"open with code\" and as i clicked on \"open with code\" you can see this folder has been opened does our old folder has been closed in vscode? no! our old folder is still opened so we will  close it and we will  maximize it and create a file here \"index.html\" why \"index.html\" do not  we have any other name? \"index.html\" is special name for a file which tells your web server to start with \"index.html\" page when someone visit your website i repeat, this is the starting point this is the point from where your website starts to be visible let me quickly show you from the notes what i have  written \"this is an special file which is presented when the website root address is types\" for eg. if \"codewithhary.com\" is purely an html website so if someone visit  \"codewithhary.com\" so its \"index.html\" page will be visible first i hope this is clear now lets have a look at a basic html page which we generated what i will  do is.. i will  type an exclamation mark (!) now look \"emmet abbreviation\" is written here what does \"emmet abbreviation\" means? emmet is a tool which helps to write html & css correctly emmet is plug-in which help the web-developers to write css & html correctly as soon as i type exclamation mark and press the \"enter\" look i will  get this boiler-plate-code of html now if i start the second one just as the first one if i start this so i only found \"doctype html\" in the same manner i can do many things we will  learn how to use these type of \"emmet abbreviation\" through out the course when i typed the exclamation mark (!) so look we got the boiler-plate-code generated here in \"index.html\" look if i add \"h1\" in the body and lets leave \"what h1 is? \" \"this is a heading\" and after this i will  write a paragraph \"this is a paragraph\" and lets leave for now for this heading & paragraph is because we just want to generate an html page and we want to open that in  a \"live server\" because we want to see how our page will look in our server look, as i opened this in a \"live server\" so what is written in the url \"127.0.0.1:5500\" which is a server created by \"live server\" extension after creating this server it is displaying \"index.html\" page through this server but.... listen to me carefully if i do not  write this \"index.html\" then what will happen? if i do not  type \"index.html\" in my url bar even then i will  get the same page \"this is a heading, this is a paragraph\" if my page was not  named \"index.html\" suppose if i rename this file lets suppose if i rename it by pressing \"f2\" and if i give it any random name if i give it \"this.html\" instead of \"index.html\" you can name it after someones name i will  name it \"harry.html\" will i be able to see anything after changing it is  name? no! look it is saying you have 3 files in this server root which one do you want to see? at first there was \"index.html\" present so it was displaying me the \"index.html\" it was telling me you have an\"index.html\" file so i will  show you \"index.html\" because \"index.html\" is an special name which is displayed to you when you visit any servers root thats why \"index.html\" is an special name and you have to remember this name when you will  create a website i should have press \"f2\" and i have  rename it to \"index.html\" and after that if i reload it, so look my document has appeared here lets have a look at this basic html page lets have a look what this is? if i visit \"codewithharry.com\" then it have its own page source it also contains all these tags we will  look how we can understand all these tags in a bare minimum page at first we will  see a \"doctype html\" in every website this specifies that it as an html 5 document it is using html 5 what is the html tag? it is a root of an html page. and what is in the head? the meta data of the page. and what do we mean by meta data? \"information about some already existing data\" which means a brief data about already existing data, this is called meta data and what is the data? data is the information you already know what data is... lets suppose you have stored someones data, address & phone number, so this is called data and what is the meta data? it means the data about the data this is already a data but meta data means \"the data about the existing data\" what is  the description of this page and what is  the title of this page there a lot of things which come under \"the head\" we will  see soon what are the those things and now as i opened this tag now i have  to close this tag too we have  to open almost all html tags and we also have to close them there are a few tags which does not  need to be closed, and those tags are called empty tags but most of the tags which we use in the page & which contains the content we have to close those type of tags i have  added opened \"head\" tag & then \"title\" tag and then i have  close the \"title\" tag and i have  added the title \"harrys website\" let me show you what \"title\" does now here the title was a document i am  displaying \"harrys website\" here now look here is some meta text her and what is the meta text? meta set means the encoding of this page is \"utf-8\" i have  specified that and now i have  specified some more things, and by the way it was generated by-default through emmet so \"view port\" & \"xu-a compatible\" what does these means? \"xu-a compatible\" is used for the microsofts old browsers compatibility and \"view port\" is used to change the initial scale there are more tags similar to these 2 tags which we can use to build our website but first of all we will  learn about some most important tags in html body contains all the tags which you will  see on this web page the tags which are displayed are present in the body now look here, i have  mentioned this in notes \"the main body of the page rendered by the browser\" this is the tag visible here and then i have  added a paragraph tag and a heading tag and then i have  closed the body because here my body closes and whatever i want to render in the browser ends here thats why i have  added the closing tag of body here so i hope you have  understood this here is the html closing tag so there were the tags which we used to create this website is this website looking good? obviously not! this website is not looking that. but this is our first website so write \"congratulations on your first website\" in the comments we have  made the first website of this course no matter how it looks but this is our first website of this course so make sure to write \"congratulations\" in comments now we will  move back to the notes and i have  written here \"the difference between the tags & elements\" \"and how does your browser render your page\" so look it is simple, the tag is the container for the content or for the more html tags for eg. look at the body tag what does it contains? it contains some more tags and along with that it also contains some content now if we talk about \"h1\" tag \"h1\" only contains a content \"this is a heading\" it does not  contain any tags so a tag can contain more tag or directly a content just like \"h1\" and the paragraph now if you want to generate a dummy paragraph through emmet so firstly write \"p\" and then press the \"enter\" and it will  complete automatically and then write \"lorem3\" as i wrote \"lorem3\" the three words have been generated now if i write \"lorem30\" will it generate 30 words ? obviously 30 words have been generated now i will  save it, look 30 words have appeared here and now if i want it to generate 300 words thats also possible \"lorem300\" 300 words have been generated here if you ever have to build a website & you do not  have any idea what to write in this website \"lorem300\" \"lorem30\" \"lorem3\" \"lorem5\" \"lorem7\" and you will  be able to see the dummy text in your paragraph so \"this is a heading\" , \"this is a paragraph\" and you can see \"lorem300\" is written here and along with that.... look here, this have been rendered and as soon as i save this page it is displaying the changes automatically after reloading by the way this is not a work of html this is the work if live server live server is an extension which reflects the changes when you save your files every time i build my website template i always use the live server this extension was made  greatly in vscode now we have  understood \"a tag is like a container\" your html document is nothing more than this it is just a piece of code whatever website you see on your daily basis just like if you are  seeing my website the actual website is not this one but this one this is the source code it is  about the code and not about the images or red colored button or anything it contains your website transports in the form of this code in actual this code gets transported and then as soon as your browser gets this code it renders this code in this form so the code is provided to the browser through server and browser renders the code in this form which you usually see so now lets understand, as soon as your browser gets this html document so your browser plays a major role in converting this code to a viewable form so i hope you got the point \"how to display an html document\" now lets talk about the important notes i have  written some things here which are important \"head and body tags are children of html tags\" so look, you can see your whole code in a way like this first you have  specified your doc-type that your doc-type will be html you will  find the first tag very unique in compare to the other tags and then our main html page starts we have  written html here and where is its closing tag? here in line #14 things it contains.... what are they? those are its children now i will  show you one thing very interesting from the vscode now if you click on the left side of \"the head\" so look they have collapsed and now they have expanded collapse-expend, collapse-expend so now look the html contains the head & the body understand this in a way that html have 2 children \"head\" & \"body\" so when html have 2 children \"head\" & \"body: so html is obviously the father of \"head\" & \"body\" this is simple man, please do not  say that you did not  understood this this is very simple thing so html is the parent of \"head\" & \"body\" and what is the relation between \"head\" & \"body\" they are \"siblings\" , this is the exact word we use \"head\" & \"body\" are siblings now look here i have  written this \"head & body are the children tags of html tags\" in the same way \"h1\" & \"paragraph\" are the children of? they are the children of \"body\" only in my case it is possible that you create a web page in which \"h1\" & \"paragraph\" is not the direct children of \"body\" we will  see this later but if we talk about this page so in this page \"h1\" & \"paragraph\" are the children of? but \"head\" & \"body\" will always be the children of html tags html is the parent of \"head\" & \"body\" tags this is the very simple thing just understand this in a way that raghav is the son of shubham so shubham will be the father of raghav most of the html elements have opening & closing tags... ...with content in between opening & closing tags just as we saw here that... h1 has the opening & closing tags with content in between just like that \"paragraph\" has the opening & closing tags with content in between we have  understood this most of the html elements have opening & closing tags with content in between we have  discussed this \"some html tags have no content\" there are some html tags which does not  contain any content for eg. \"br\" and \"hr\" htmls hr tag and what is htmls hr tag? this is used to create a horizontal line we will  talk about these tags now lets move downward and see \"we can either use \\'.htm\\' or \\'.html\\' extension\" along with \".html\" we can also use \".htm\" extension if we do not  add \"l\" in \".html\" if we are lazy and we do not  want to type the whole \"html\" but we only want to type \"htm\" so you are  welcome you can do that too your templates will work but i want to give you a disclaimer sometimes.....let me show you the live server is unable to detect the \"index.htm\" it detects \"index.html\" as a starting page but if you open the \"index.htm\" so you will  get this page totally rendered which means we mostly have to use \".html\" extension and we do not  have to use \".htm\" theres a reason for that because if someone write code in backend or create an extension or a piece of software so they sometimes forgot that they also have to add \".htm\" as a supportive extension because mostly \".html\" is used so if they have not  added \".htm\" as a supportive extension for eg. live server they have not  added this in live server to detect the \".htm\" extension which is why when we visit the route it does not  display in case of \".htm\" now i have  changes the name of my file to \"index.html\" thats why it is displaying so we always have to use \".html\" but we have to be aware that \".htm\" is also a valid extension of html files now we will  talk about the comments but first i want to tell you a fun feature which you might already know \"inspect element or view page source options\" we got these 2 options what is \"inspect elements\" used for? it is used to inspect any element for eg. i will  show you on my website if i do right click on \"browse blog\" and then click on \"inspect\" now look, blog browse blog if i change \"browse blog\" with something like this \"browse this website\" so look it has changed to ]\"browse this website\" if i inspect \"contact me\" and then if i change this with \"contact shubham\" and then if i click anywhere. so look it has changed to \"contact shubham\" is it changes for everyone? no this has changed here temporarily so it is not about that you can change this website by inspecting element if this was possible then you and i have changed a lot of website till now so you cannot change the backend but you can change the frontend only or your browser just like i have  shown you so you can do this but it is  not like that you can change the website for everyone so this is not possible when i will  reload this page everything will be back to the normal so i hope you all have understood this \"inspect element\" and i have  already told about \"view page source\" that you can see the whole page source by this feature one more thing i want to tell you about \"inspect element\" when you will  click on this arrow in the google chrome then you can inspect any element for eg. if i want to inspect this one so look here is the button and then if i click here and then on this image so look this has been inspected and then if i click here... ...and then here so look this \"lambda image\" has been inspected so i hope this is cleared to you along with that i want to tell you if you click this on your phones so you can see how your website looks in different phones so this is how my website looks in pixel 2 and if you open my website in ipad so this is how it looks and if you open this in galaxy fold so this is how it looks so the website is responsive and what is the meaning of responsive? responsive means if you use this website in any device so it looks good it is  not like if you a build  website for just phones and if you are  opening that in a computer so it is creating problem responsive means that your website is adaptive to all devices so nowadays responsiveness is must for websites if any client ask you to build website so he  will not  specify you 10 years ago responsiveness was an extra feature it was count as an extra feature provided by a good programmer but nowadays it is a necessity not an option 10 years ago it was optional nowadays internet is used more in phones as compare to computers so thats why people check it for phones first so thats why the \"mobile first\" concept is widely used \"mobile first\" means the website is first responsive in phones whether or not responsive in computer is second concern because the mostly used devices for internet are phones & tablets and other pocket devices so i hope you have  understood what responsiveness is and how to make a website responsive? we will  create that through css & js bur now we are  only learning html so thats why we will  first finish this html step and then we will  move to the responsiveness you can use \"inspect elements\" & \"view page source\" and html elements = start tag + content + end tag so the html element..... whenever i talk about a tag so by that i mean h1 or h1s closing tag h1 is the opening tag and this h1 is a closing tag so whenever i am  saying \"tag\" i mean this tag or this one but when i am  saying \"element\" so i mean this whole line this whole \"this is a heading\" is an element so it is an element & look here html elements = start tag + content + end tag so start tag & content & end tag creates an html element now lets talk about comments what are comments? lets suppose if i want to write something here i want to write why i added this heading i want to specify this, i want to write \"this heading will be changed in future\" future is pronounced as fu-tu-rey sorry it is written as fu-tu-rey but pronounced as \"future\" so now if i move to here the problem is, it is also displaying on my web page i just want to write this but i do not  want to display it but google chrome is displaying my line so is there a way for me to write notes here? for eg. i want to write here \"improve below paragraph\" so lets suppose if i want to improve this paragraph so what will i do? what to do when i do not  want it to display here? i have  written \"improve below paragraph\" here but i do not  want it to be visible because these are my notes these are the notes which i do not  want to display to the user but i want to keep these notes for me as i will  press \"ctrl + / \" look it has been converted to a comment and i will  again press \"ctrl + / \" \"this heading will be changed in future\" has been commented out this means it  will not  be displayed in my web page these are the comments things which exist but you do not  want to display them in your web page... ...are called comments what are the comments? lets read \"comments in html are used to mark text which should not  be parsed\" what do parsed means? when this source code of html converts in this form this is called parsing google chrome is reading this code & then displaying it in this form to the user, this is called parsing parsing is called to understand this code, tags & elements so now if i want it to ignore some lines of text which i do not  want to display i will  do right click > view page source so look it has been ignored \"this heading will be changed in future\" has been ignored and \"improve this paragraph\" is also ignored i want it to be ignored by google chrome so i made it a comment and google chrome has obeyed me and it has been ignored so these are the comments and i also have written comments here if you use notepad for your html coding so you have to write this yourself you can use \" ctrl + /\" to do comment & uncomment comment means to comment any text uncomment means to uncomment any text which is already commented commenting-uncommenting.... and we will  use this terminology a lot while programming i will  leave \"improve below paragraph\" & \"this heading will be changed in future\" i will  leave all these as they are and read the next point \"case sensitivity\" is html a case sensitive language?  no! html is a case insensitive language i mean if you use lowercase or uppercase it does not  matter it will  work properly if i write this tag as a capital-p and if i change this to a capital-p so will my browser show it correctly? yes it will  show it correctly, look if i reload it so a capital-p has been appeared here so i can use uppercase or lowercase i can use any but lowercase tags are highly recommended i know it will  work but lowercase tags are highly recommended this is a whole element & \\'p\\' is an opening tag and this \\'p\\' is a closing tag i hope you got the point now we will  move to chapter 1s practice set and we will  practice some things and we will  also grasp these things which we understood & make sure to download the notes i have  written these notes for you so please download them these notes are very helpful and i will  provide the pdf of these notes to download in the description so i hope you have  understood this html websites structure you will  also get the codes & notes & everything i am  writing here lets move in to chapter 1 practice set so guys this is the chapter 1 practice set which i am  opening here and i have  added some questions in it which will help you to understand html better now look \"inspect your favourite website & change something on the page which is displayed\" this is a very simple exercise but i want you do this on your own because if you inspect a website so first take away you will  get is... ...that you will  learn to change your favourite websites and that can be any website i will  change the \"codewithharry\" website so now we are on \"codewithhary.com\" and i will  show you changing this by the way i already did that one time before lets suppose i want to change \"contact me\" and i want to change it to... \"contact this person\" so this is how i can change this and make sure to try this on your own try to change it it is  not important to change this website and i know that 90% of you will change \"codewithhary\" try another website you can change anything or you can also use \"codewithhary try to change your favourite website it is very fun when the web page is changed very few people are familiar with that and those who know is good for theirselves go to your favourite website & try to view the page source and write the exact lines of code does it clone the website? why? visit any website & do right click > view page source and see if you are  able to clone that website or not now what i will  do is... i will  try to clone this website but you can use any website of your choice you can clone \"wikipedia\" and i will  open the \"wikipedia\" and then i will  do right click > view page source and i will  copy it is  source and after copying this source look here are many things here are a lot of stuff and i will  create a file \"practice.html\" and i will  open it with \"live server\" so look this is the wikipedia which i copied and this one is the actual wikipedia so you can see that the website is not copied exactly and you should know the reason about that what was the reason that the website was unable to be cloned? so look when you use css in your website so you sometimes use relative links theres an absolute link what is absolute link? if i command my computer to visit \"codewithhary.com\" so this is the absolute path of this website but how can i command it to visit relative i can command it to visit \"codewithhary.com/blogs\" which websites \"/blogs\" ? \"codewithhary\" so if you visit \"/blogs\" so you will  be here and if you visit \"/videos\" so you will  be here if you click on \"/contact me\" so you will  be here and  if you click on \"/start watching\" so you will  be here when you visit \"/videos/java tutorial for beginners\" so you end up on this page so they have added a mixture of absolute & relative links in the source of wikipedia and your version of wikipedia is unable to find the relative links... ...which are related to \"wikipedia.org\" but it is trying to find that pages on \"127.0.0:5500\" let me show you this but if you are  unable to understand this so please ignore it but if you are able to understand this then well & good but if you are not.... then you will  learn it do not  be tensed about it so look here are some pages which were unable to load which is why it is showing the error and those things are unable to be load because... you have not  added the paths correctly so to clone a whole website you have  to do some more things we will  talk about them later so i just wanted to make you do exercise for cloning a website through this question so you can have a good idea about it is not that easy to clone a website so it is not that easy so i wanted to tell you this write any html code inside a text file. does it work if you write it using notepad? will it work if you execute it using notepad? now open this and i will  provide you a new text document after writing \"new text document\" i will  write... ...\"notepad.html\" i will  do one thing, for now i will  just change it to \"notepad.txt\" and i will  add some html code in it and i will  copy html code form here have you noticed something? \"notepad.txt\" is here vscode does not  perform any type of magic it only does what you can do with notepad but because you can perform all those task here in organized manner so thats why we use vscode or you use an alternate of vscode so i will  copy this in \"notepad.txt\" i have  opened \"notepad.txt\" twice but no problem so i have  done \"this is heading will be changed in future\" something like this so now i will  change \".txt\" with \".html\" i will  click on \"yes\" and then.... i will  open my \"notepad.html\" with live server or instead of opening it with live server if i click on this twice so also then it will  work \"notepad.html\" is working so why are we using live server when it is supported in notepad we are using live server because it creates a server in actual whenever you will  do coding in html or create any website in future so all files will be serve through a server if we use a server from the beginning so that will  be good for us so thats why we use live server so i hope this practice set was very beneficial for you and you have  understood this easily now we will  move to chapter-2 where we will  learn about some basic tags i will  see you in chapter-2 so guys we are now on chapter-2 in which we will  learn about some basic tags and we will  use those tags to create some websites so i will  quickly open the chapter-2 i will  open the pdf which i created for you and as you can see i have  written about some basic tags here we can add elements inside the body tag to define the page layout we have  learned that we have a body tags which is rendered by the body and we can add some tags in that body tag which will be visible to us in the browser we have  learned about h1 tag and we have  also learned about the \"paragraph\" tags and we learned that when we use these 2 tags then we got a heading & paragraph how many more such tags are there? and what type of tags can we use? and what are tags which we can use to create a good looking website? or i will  say a good enough website so we are going to learn more about this we can add elements inside the body tag to define the page layout i will  talk about html element what do i mean by html element html elements means an opening tag & a closing tag whenever we write an html tag we write 2 tags \"opening tag & closing tag\" and the content in between this content can be a text or more opening & closing tags so thats why i have  written this as content i can also write this as  then any heading and then  now pay attention to one thing in opening & closing tag whenever we write a tag inside this angular brackets and we have to close that, so what we will  do? we add a forward slash(/) and we write the name of that tag which means  and it becomes a closing tag we will  open & close all the tags in the way in html we will  create html elements here i will  click right > open with code and this folder has been opened in vscode so now look i have  opened this folder in vscode now we will  create a website here and the name for html page will be \"index.html\" for obvious reasons now i will  add an exclamation mark(!) here and an emmet abbreviations will appear i will  press the \"enter\" and then press the \"tab\" x3 and now i am  inside the body now i will  write h1 here now what emmet is saying? it is saying \" where will you write the whole h1? \" emmet is saying \"my son....\" \"...do not  write the whole h1 tag....\" \"....just press the \\'enter\\' and i will  see the rest\" emmet is so good there are very few people like emmet in this world just write \"h1\" and then \"list of books\" you have  written \"list of books\" or i will  write \"books to read\" \"books to read\" i will  write whatever the heading i want to add and then i will  write \"p\" and then i will  write \"there are a lot of books to read for you\" and now i will  save it and then i will  open it with live server & you know what will happen and it will  open in liver server and then i will  be able too see this heading & paragraph so look i have  written an opening tag & a closing tag & then a content in between what is meant by content? content can be a text or a combination of opening & closing tag for eg. we have     tags in the body and in turn we have some content in  which is \"books to read\" so this is how we define the html elements element is the combination of opening tag, content & closing tag and what is tag? here are the some example of tags tags means anything which is written in this way element is the combination of all these 3 things lets talk about html attributes what are the html attributes & why do we need them? sometimes you have to supply some more information along with tags for eg. if i move to my vscode so theres no need for me to supply more information with this h1 tag i just want to tell what is the content in h1 tag i only want to tell this but if i use an anchor tag here i want to tell you about one more tag which is an anchor tag if you write \"a\" and then pressed \"enter\" so look an attribute has been added here it saying \"please tell in which url i have  to go\" first let me tell you about the anchor tag if you click on a text which is in anchor tag so it will  redirect you to a url so it is asking for the location so this is an attribute href = what? it is asking you you have to add \"href = https://codewithharry.com\" and then write the content \"click here to go to harrys website\" suppose you have  written something like this now when you look at it you will  found a link on \"click here to go to harrys website\" and when you click on it you will  be redirected to \"codewithharry.com\" so what is the \\'href\\' written with the anchor tag in actual \\'href\\' is a link to a website and it will  open whenever you will  click on this text so if you want to be redirected to \"codewithharry.com\" by clicking on the text... ...\"click here to go to harrys website\" so yo can add the website’s address in the href so this is the attribute and there can be more than one attribute for eg. i could have  add some attributes here \"class = \"me\" \" and \"id = \"that\" \" so this is how you can add a lot of attributes i will  remove these 2 attributes and i will  only leave 1 attribute here which is of \\'href\\' so this is the attribute how can you write the attribute? first of all the name of the attribute and then \" = \" and then the attribute in double quotes(\" \") can i use the single quotes(\\' \\') ? yes i can use them so look we can use single quotes(\\' \\') will it work if i write this in single quotes(\\' \\') yes definitely it will work! so look i have  added \"href =\" in single quotes(\\' \\') this will definitely work so what is the difference between single quotes(\\' \\') & double quotes(\" \") ? look you can use any one from the single quotes (\\' \\') & double quotes (\" \") but the attribute you are  about to enter contains a double quotes (\" \") for some weird reason lets suppose this will be my website so you cannot use the double quotes (\" \") here if you have  used the double quotes (\" \") then it would have confused... ...in the closing tags so it will  think that you have  only written this much after the \\'href\\' so it will  be confused and can also give a syntax error so if you are  using the double quotes (\" \") in your attributes content so remember to use single quotes(\\' \\') in the outer and vice versa if you are  using the single quotes(\\' \\') in attribute so use the double quotes (\" \") or else you can use anyone from the single quotes(\\' \\') & double quotes (\" \") but in the end, i will  advice you to maintain the consistency. what you have to do? you have  to maintain the consistency if you are  using the single quotes(\\' \\') then keep using them and if you are  using the double quotes (\" \") then keep using them so i will  remove these double quotes (\" \") from here because here the url of the website is this one & it does not  contain the double quotes (\" \") so now we have  understood this so i have  written in the notes for you \"attribute used to add more information corresponding to an html tag\" which means an html tag is already written and you are  using this to add some additional information corresponding to that attribute for eg. if theres an anchor tag and you are  specifying the href attribute and writing it is  value in it so first the name of the attribute and then after \" = \" the value of attribute in double quotes (\" \") or single quotes(\\' \\') and then you can write the tag as usual now i have  written here we either use single quotes (\\' \\') or double quotes (\" \") in attribute and now comes the heading tag lets discuss the heading tag whenever you build your website or any page of your website then you would like to give it a heading heading tag is used to mark headings in html if you want to make any text a heading so you can use the heading tag and you can use from the h1 to the h6 for the headings h1 means the most important heading h2 means less important than h1 h3 means less important than h2 h4 means less important than h3 and h6 means the least important heading h6 specify the least important heading if you use the h6 then it is the least important heading so use the h1 for the most important heading \"we have tags for the most important to the least important headings\" which means we have the tags for the most important to the least important heading in the html i have  written a not here you will  write all these code and i will  also show you this by typing but first let me type this & show you so you can have a good idea about this what will be the difference you notice when you write from the h1 all the way to the h6 i will  also tell you about a trick now if you press \"alt\" key in your keyboard and then whenever you click somewhere, a cursor will appear and if you click there again... ...the cursor will be gone the benefit of making multiple cursors is you can change text easily just like i have  changed these 2 to h2 and then you can change then to h3 by pressing \"alt\" key and then you can change this to h4 and then again.... i have  made a mistake, i have  made h4 twice i just had to change it to h4 here and here and then i have  to add h5 here and i also have to remove the cursor and then by pressing \"ctrl + d\" i will  add a cursor here and change it to h6 so now look.... i have  closed it mistakenly thats good that i managed to saved it i have  saved it & look how this page is rendering h1 will look like this and may be this too is h1, i have  written h1 twice if i am  not wrong yes i am  not wrong, i have  written h1 twice no worries so this is the h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 & h6 when we move to h6 from the h1 so not only their size changes their importance also decrease what does it means? whenever the search engines like google will read your page so they will  think.. ...that you are  writing the most important heading in the h1 and after that as you are  using the h2, h3, h4.... you are  decreasing the importance which means if you have  used the h1 for \"books to read\" so the search engine will think or any bot whos crawling your website will think that the h1 is the primary topic of your page so you have to use the h1.....h6 tags very wisely if you want the search engine optimization and if you want to convey your pages content easily with any bot, crawler or a search engine so use the tag wisely you never have to use the h1-h6 tags to define the sizes of the headings i have  seen some people who learned the html recently use the h1-h6 tags in a way to define the sizes of the heading for eg. h1 for the bigger heading & h6 for the smaller we do not  have to do this and we have to use the heading carefully we have to write the paragraph with the paragraph tag and we have to write the headings with the heading tag we have to use them carefully now look, i have  told you about paragraphs, anchors and all that now lets move back to the notes i have  written something here which i have  just told you note:- we should not use html headings to make text thick or bold we do not  have to use the headings to determine the size of the texts then in what purpose we have to use the headings? we have to use the headings when we are actually writing the headings and not when we have  to change the size of the text or design them i hope you got the point now we will  move forward to the next tag which we have already seen paragraph tag and what does paragraph tag do? i have  told you it is used to add paragraph and how you can add paragraph and if you want to change the paragraph so you can change it like this when i will  write \"lorem34\" so 34 words will appear by the way look a horizontal scroll bar has appeared here and if you want a view like this instead of this horizontal scroll bar let me show you what i am  talking about now if we click on \"toggle word wrap\" so this scroll bar will disappear and line no. will appear which means in actual this is not the line #17 but only this content is line #17 but this is displaying you in multiple lines so you do not  have to scroll it horizontally this is called word wrap and we can see the word wrap functionality in a lot of ides so i have  enabled my word wrap so the lines which are actually bigger than my screen width, will be shown like this so line #17 is actually this big line #18 is this big that it is fit within a line so the bigger lines will be shown in the same screen width and i do not  have to use the horizontal screen bar and i definitely have to use the vertical scroll bar i hope you have  understood... ...what is word wrap and we should use that so we have  learned paragraph tag and the lorem trick whenever you write the \"lorem\" so do not  think if you write \"lorem45\" in notepad so a text of 45 words will be generated this is the feature of emmet which is built-in feature of vscode you do not  have to install the emmet it is build-in feature of vscode i hope you have  understood this and if the emmet is not working in your vscode that means you have installed a buggy extension it usually happens that if you install a buggy extension or an extension which disables your emmet knowingly or accidentally so you can face problem by the way emmet works perfectly 99.99% of the times and this case is very rare, but if this happens so restore the vscode and it will  be fix i hope you have  understood this now we will  move back to the notes and we will  have a look on anchor tag what is anchor tag? anchor tag is used to add links to an existing content inside an html page which means if you want to add links in an html page it means if you want to redirect the user to a different page within the site or you want to redirect the user globally to a different website so you can the anchor tag just like i have  added an absolute url here of \"codewithharry.com\" so if someone clicks on this so they will  be redirected to the harrys website if i write \"href = /about.html\" and if i press the \"tab\" key & write here \"go to about\" so it will  try to visit the \"about.html\" i will  create an \"about.html\" here i will  change the title with \"about\" and i will  write \"lorem45\" by writing a paragraph and then i will  write \"this is about\" a very simple thing from \"index.html\" as i click on \"go to about\" so look i have  been redirected to \"about.html\" this is the relative link so i will  write one thing here \"example of absolute link and example of...\" \"example of absolute link\" and i will  comment it out because i do not  want it to be displayed on my website and then.... \"example of relative link\" and it is the example of relative link which you are  commanding to redirect the user to about.html within the server and what are you commanding here? you are  commanding \"https://\" which means theres a website on internet \"codewithharry\" redirect on that so these two are different the difference is in this you can visit globally from any computer but in this you can only visit when you are  in a same server which means you have to only use the relative link when you are  in your server actually i am  using live server so i know that heres an \"about.html\" so thats why i will  go to the \"about.html\" but if you send this to someone else and ask them to go to \"/about.html\" so he  will not  be able to visit this file in my server but if you are  hosting you website so yes he can visit your about.html i hope you got the point. but if you are  confused, so do not  be simply absolute link means you are  providing the full address and relative link means you are  telling where you want to go form here which means you have the same server what is my server right now? this is the url of my server \"/about.html\" so i am  now in \"/about.html\" i can press the back button and i will  be on my previous position i hope you have  understood the anchor tag and it is  href attribute & absolute and relative links now we will  talk about the \"image tags\" image tag is very simple & straight forward they are used to add images in your html page it means if you want to add images in your html page so you can use the img tag theres also it is  attribute which is src which tell you which image you want to add  or the complete address of the image for eg. if i want to use the image tag here and if i write \"image tag\" and then.... i am  changing the line with \"ctrl + enter\" by the way many people ask me about the keyboard shortcuts so i am  using \"ctrl + enter\" and then i will  write \"img\" and i will  add an address in the src and i will  add the address of any image in the src i will  search for the images on the internet and we can search for any image and i will  visit the \"unsplash\" btw \"unsplash\" is a very api. let me tell you why and firstly i will  visit the url of this image and i will  paste that in src and look this image has been added on my page so if this is how i can images on my web page if i want to obviously it is not looking quite good but this is how we add images now what is \"alt\" suppose if this image is unable to load by any reason so what text you want to display? lets suppose you want to show \"human image\" i know this is very weird but \"alt\" means the text that should be shown when the image is unable to load if i change this to \"unsplash4.com\" so this image might not load and i will  be able to see \"human image\" which means the \"alt\" and now if i fix the url which i messed up so as i will  save it then i  will not  be able to see the \"alt\" which means the text in the \"alt\" will only be shown when the image is unable to be load i hope this is clear, because this is very simple & straight forward lets move back to the notes and i forgot to mention about the \"alt\" in the notes but emmet asked me about the \"alt\" automatically btw i want to tell you one more thing when you will  put your mouse arrow on it so look it displaying some documentation and this is displaying about the image url what you have to write in srcs and which is the paragraph and do you want to open mdn reference? so it will  redirect you to the \"developer.mozilla.org\" so i hope you’ve understood how you can open the docs within the server by clicking on some links we will  now quickly move to the notes of chapter-2 and learn \"bold, italic & underline tags\" btw i have  told you about the relative & absolute tag so the same thing is applicable to the images i have  save it as image and save it in chapter-2 folder with a name \"image.jfif\" it is  extension will be add automatically \"image.jfif\" look this \"image.jfif\" has appeared here now i will  add another image tag here and after copy-pasting it i have  made a replicate line shortcut with (ctrl + d) from the keyboard shortcuts i have  already mentioned that in a video earlier \"learn vscode in one video\" give it a shot later but now focus on how i will  add the \"/image.jfif\" in the src and i will  render the same image again so look this image has the src if i do \"open image in new tab\" so this is it is  source but if i do \"open image in new tab\" here so this \"image.jfif\" has been downloaded which means the source of image is \"image.jfif\" i hope this thing is cleared to you that what is the source of this image and how you can use the relative & absolute link... ...to display the images so the link of this image is absolute image sorry! absolute source url and this is the relative url because you added \"/image.jfif\" which means the \"image.jfif\" from my server and here you have  added image from \"images.unsplash.com/.....\" url so i hope you have  understood how to write the absolute & relative urls now we will  move back to the notes and we will  talk about the \"bold, italic & underline tags\" we can use \"bold, italic & underline tags\" to highlight our texts so let me give you a demo of \"bold, italic & underline tags\" so i will  write \"bold, italic & underline tags\" and obviously i will  comment it out and i will  add a  tag here and then i will  write \"this is bold\" and then i will  add an  tag here and i will  write \"this is italic\" and then i will  add an  tag here and i will  write \"this is underline\" and after saving it, look these tags has appeared here \"this is bold\" \"this is italic\" and \"this is underline\" maybe it has appeared twice ah.... i forgot to save it so here it appears once \"this is bold\" this is italic & this is underline btw i will  do one thing here i am  commenting out both the image tags the reason being.... they are occupying a lot of space you can uncomment them later now our page is looking quite clean so i have  written \"this is bold\" \"this is italic\" & \"this is underline\" did you notice something? \"this is bold\" \"this is italic\" & \"this is underline\" appeared in a single line which means if i add a new line here even then this new line  will not  be displayed as you can see new line has not been displayed and i have  even saved the page so even if i add multiple new lines, that  will not  effect it\" or if i add some extra spaces.. look how many extra i have  added here here i have  written \"this is      italic\" and what does rendered here? \"this is italic\" this means the html ignores the extra spaces & new lines it  will not  effect html if you have  added new line explicitly this totally means that you cannot add new line here in this manner so how will you add new line? i have  already told you in my notes with the help of  tag  tag is used to create line breaks in html which means if you want \"this is bold\" \"this is italic\" & \"this is underline\" in different lines so you must use  tag  is an empty tag and this is how you can write  tag and wherever you will  add  tag a new line will be added i will  expect a new line after \"this is bold\" and \"this is italic\" and i  will not  expect a new line after \"this is underline\" so look new lines appeared after these 2 but there is no new line after \"this is underline\" so prove this i will  add \"this is underline2\" and it will  appear on the same line as you can see so i hope this thing is cleared to you that how you can highlight your text within the page big & small tags we have big & small tags in html and we can use them to... this is big or this is small i will  add the \"small\" in \"this is small\" this is small and as you can see i have  got big & small of different size and now after this we will  talk about how you can add a horizontal divider in html theres and  tag for it as i am  explaining you these topics just as i explained the topic of heading & paragraph i will  write \"heading & paragraph\" and i will  comment it out and after heading 7 paragraph i explained you about links i want that i will  separate them with a horizontal line and then i explained you about the image tag so i want it to separate it with a horizontal line and then i explained you about the \"bold, italic & underline\" and i want to separate it with a horizontal line i have  written    here and look i am  able to see the horizontal lines so why am i seeing this horizontal line? because i have  added  tags here and now i have not  displayed these images here so let me display it where is my image? here it is now you will  able to see this properly so as you can see these are the links this is the image & this one is the \"bold & italic\" part i will  shorten the image a little bit and i can do that by using the height & width attribute if i add \"width = 121px\" so it is  width will be 121px so this is how i can set its width & height but it is  highly recommended that you set the height & width of any image with the help of css (cascading style sheets) we will  learn about this later but for now we will  move forward and learn about more tags which are the subscripts & superscripts tags we add subscripts & superscripts as follows if you want to add subscripts what is the meaning of subscript? subscript is used for.... for eg. if i want to write a chemical formula formula of carbon dioxide co₂ so how will i write that? this is how i will  write. first let me write subscripts & superscripts and here i will  write \"h\"... let me first write a paragraph here i will  write c.... and then o..... and then... i will  write a subscript and then i will  write a \"2\" inside it so look this is how co₂ will render here i will  also remove the space from here so co₂ will render like this which is ideally looking good so this is how you can write co₂ now lets suppose if you want to write an equation and you have to write (a² + b² + c) something like this so what you can write? you can write \"a\" and then a superscript and then \"2\" so this is how you can write (a²) and then let us say you want to write (+bx) and then (+c) so this is how you can write that let me zoom it of you have not  seen it yet by the way i’m zooming it and i have  done 500% so thats why it is looking quite big i have not  done any magic ( a² + bx + c ) let me change it to to ( ax² ) you can write any equation so i have  written ( ax² + bx + c ) i will  reset it with (ctrl + scroll) by clicking on reset it will  be reset to its original size now we will  talk about \"pre tag\" now what is \"pre tag\" ? i have  already shown you that html always ignore extra spaces & new lines now if we want to display a text as we have written it for eg. if i take any random python code and i will  search for it if i find any python code.... from anywhere theres nothing to be worried about lets take a code form \"python.org\" lets take a code form the python docs and if i can find any small code a small one python please give me a small code lets suppose i want to take this and i have  copied it and then i have  pasted it with a hope.. ...that it will  be displayed as it is i mean all the new lines will appear and when i will  save it... i have  to face disappointment because this whole code has been displayed in a single line neither these new lines appear nor these extra spaces it did preserve nothing but if i want these type of extra spaces & new lines to be preserved which means i should get the text as it is so what will i do? i can use the \"pre tag\" which means i will  write the opening pre tag here and then i will  write the closing pre tag here now look what will happen that whatever is inside the opening & closing pre tag will be displayed as they are so look \"this means that\" \"svs.getfilesystemcoding() return.....\" whatever the spaces & new lines there was you can see the them in this text and if i add more new lines here so look we are able to see a lot of new lines so if you want to that your text will render as it is so you can use pre tags pre tags are used to add codes if you want to render your code on html websites so use pre tags so that your new lines will preserve as they are so this was chapter-2 i hope you have  understood these basic tags in the upcoming chapters we will  learn some more htm l tags but before that lets do some practice of chapter-2 lets move on to chapter-2 practice set so guys we are now here to solve the practice set of chapter-2 and i am  going to open the pdf of chapter-2 and i have  also opened the chapter-2s pdf it does not  matter we have  learned a lot of things we learned about big, small, pre, subscript & superscript tags and i think it was fun because we have  learned how to build a website now what we will  do is, we will  do some questions so that you can hold tight on to the html and you can understand better about whatever the tags, properties & attribute we have  learned so the first question is, \"create an html page with a heading\" which is going to be the title of the page and yes not this title but the title heading, theres a heading which is the title of the whole page and then theres a primary heading and a sub heading so what i will  do is... i will  open this same folder in the vscode because this is the chapter-2s practice set i will  create a file here with a name \"chater_2_practice_set\" or \"practice_set.html\" i will  add boiler plate code and i will  name it \"chapter 2 practice set\" and in the body i am  going to add the code from which we are going to solve this question so if i want to add a primary heading so it definitely will be h1 and lets suppose i am  writing about the mountains and after that.... let us say, i am  adding the secondary heading and i am  writing \"why mountains\" and let us say i have  written a paragraph which contains 45 words and i will  turn on the word wrap i have  told you how to turn on the word wrap so that the text will be displayed without any scroll bar so line #12 which might not fit in one line is displayed like this this is the single line but it is presented in this way and here is the line #13 this is possible because of word wrap and after \"why mountain?\" i am  going to add a sub heading in it and...... the main reason lets suppose we are writing the main reasons and the paragraph and lets suppose we have  written 45 words in the main reasons so when i will  open my page in live server so this is what it will  look like so theres a page heading and theres \"why mountains\" and then theres a sub heading \"the main reasons\" so we had to this we had to create an html page with a heading which is going to contain the title heading, primary heading & the sub heading\" what tags have you used in it? was i able to use the any other tag? yes definitely i was able and when you will  learn the css then you will  know how many options you have to solve this question and when you will  learn the css you will  find that you can change the size of any element and when you can do that so sometimes you become too greedy to use the easy tags just like changing the font & paragraph so i do not  want you to be trapped in the greed i know you will  get an intuitive feeling that lets finish this in an easy way but in actual will that page be read by any robot? will that page be an seo friendly? you must ask these type of questions from yourselves when you do that \"create a page with 5 wallpaper images taken from the internet\" you have to take 5 wallpapers from the internet and you have to display them and if i search for wallpaper then to the images and if you only want to display them so you can find a lot of wallpaper images look we have  got a lot of wallpaper images so you can use any wallpaper from this it does not  matter which wallpaper you will  use if i use this wallpaper i will  do right click > open image in new tab and i will  copy the url of this image and take this so you just have to choose any wallpaper from these wallpaper & you have to display it and you have to solve this question on your own i am  not going to solve this the reason is... you should have knowledge about how to do this because i already have shown many examples and the third question is to \"use br & hr tags to display a piece of text with line bricks\" try this question too on your own because i want to keep this video short & to the point thats why i have  given questions for the practice so that you can do practice on your own the forth question is \"try the following equation using html\" you have  to write this equation from html (  c  +  o₂  ➜  co₂  ) this is the equation of carbon oxidization so we will  write this let me tell you how you can write this in a paragraph you can write it  ( c  +  o2 ➜  co2 ) if you write it like this so this is how it will  be displayed let me show you something like this and which is not looking good i need subscript tags so i will  select it and then i will  write here sub and then 2 i will  remove this space, and similarly i will  use the sub tag here and then i will  write 2 and i will  remove this space now look... the equation is now displayed correctly (  c  +  o₂  ➜  co₂  ) so this reaction is looking quite correctly so ideally you want that your reaction will look like this so i want to tell you one more thing now if we have talked about the chemical reaction so let me tell you you can.. take the arrow of the html from the internet so let me show you how you can display these type of arrows so look they have given a lot of codes of html so if you use \"m%rarr\" so you can use the arrow symbol of html so we have a lot of social symbols of this type which you can use in html let me show you one use of this type of arrow so look this is how this arrow looks and you can use these type of arrows in html and there are a lot of symbols in html which you can use and the codes for those symbols are also given here so i hope you have  understood this so if you ever want to use these type of arrows so you can search on internet that is html provide these type of symbols or not in my case it was providing and i got the right arrow symbol in html thats why i use that so i hope you have  understood how to do this \"try write a wikipedia article using html\" and i want you to solve this question on your own let us say i want to open the wikipedia page of programming and i want to replicate this page what type of tags will you use? lets guess what tag will it be this is definitely a heading tag you can inspect it and it will be the h1 tag this is the primary heading of this page so this will be h1 tag lets suppose if you  will not  find this h1 in any page so the developer of that page has made a mistake because if you have not  use the heading tag even in your heading so theres something wrong with your page your page can be displayed using the css without using the heading tags but it will  not be called best practice you have to do this with a good practice if you use best software techniques for building website or apps then you will  get advantages i just want to tell you this now i will  close this because our chapter-2 practice set has been completed i have  also hand picked some question so that you can do your practice after completing the chapter-2 i just want to keep these notes as if you have these notes & this video then whenever you will  turn the page you will  remember everything and i also have given practice so that if you ever have to do revision then you just have to turn some pages now we will  move to the chapter-3 and in chapter-3 we will  learn how we can structure a website because if you learn how to structure a website then you can easily create any type of website yes i know our website is not looking that good because we have not  used the css but if we learn how to structure our website so it will  be a good win for us lets move to the chapter-3 now so lets quickly open the pdf of chapter-3 and after opening the pdf we will  learn how to create a page layout so chapter-3 is about creating a page layout and i have  written something here and they have a very deep meaning and thats why i will focus on that and i have  written very minimal amount of notes and i will  close the rest of the tabs when we use the right tag in a right place this help us to create a better page layout and it also help for the better indexing through search engines and it also provides better user experience and i have  used the word \"better\" here because what is the meaning of better? \"more satisfactory\" the work will be more satisfactory look if you  will not  use the right tags and create the website but will the search engines be able to index it? will your website appear on google? will your user get a good experience? what is the meaning of user experience? lets suppose if you install the third party javascript library or if you use third-party css frame work it is possible that they have targeted some particular tags like header or footer and you are  not using that layout so maybe you will  face problems while using that library thats why i am  suggesting better user experience so now we will  learn how to create a layout of a website ideally your website will contain a header and then a main tag and a footer so now if i quickly show you this page in vscode and then if i create an \"index.html\" so look.... i will ..... what shall i call it? it is called boiler plate code boiler plate code of html will appear here and i will  create it with a name \"chapter-3\" now what i will  do is... as i have  told you about a header tag i have  used a header tag here and then i will  use a main tag here and then i will  add a paragraph here and i will  write \"this is the main content\" and after pressing ( ctrl + enter ) i will  move downward and after \"main\" i will  create a footer with and as you will  create these tags vscode will completely support you by \"support\" i means that whenever you will  write something it will  auto-complete it if you put you arrow won any particular tag so it will  provide you a link for mdn reference so it will  become very easy for you to understand things and to do to the reference of a particular tag so look i have not  added anything in the header for now i will  write \"this is header\" and in footer i will  write \"this is footer\" i will  save it & open it with live server and my website will open in live server and as you can see \"this header\" \"this is the main content\" &  \"this is footer\" and many of you might think that \"what was the need to do this? \" i can directly do this by added paragraphs a human can know that how this website is structured but a robot  will not  be able to see this it can only see this and how will it know that what is main content, header & footer of your website? footer & header is not that important  as the main content so you have to add the main content of your website in between these 2 tags with that it will  become easy for you to read & for the search engines also and you also want that search engines can easily understand the content of your website why that? because you want that traffic must hit your website if you are  a blogger or you provide any type of service so you want the traffic on your website and you want the people to come on your website & appreciate your hard work so we have learned about the se index and now we will  move back to the chapter-3 notes and we will  learn how to use these 3 tags so we add navigation bar in the header and we add nav tag in it and in in main tags we add \"section\" article\" & \"aside\" tag and these three tags are most commonly used tags you can add \"div\" here we will  learn more about \"div\" later but these 3 are the most important tags which you must have knowledge about these are the opening & closing tags of main tag basically we have  talked about header, footer & main tag and now we are  diving deep in the main tag we are  trying to understand what should main tag contain but i have  added paragraph in the main tag but in actual what should the main tag contain i will  comment this out because i added this paragraph just to show you i will  create a section in main tag and what sections\\' mean? let me explain the meaning of section when you create a section tag it means you want to display a particular part of your page to users when you write an article it might have been that you have  written a particular thing in your page so there you can use the article tag what type of content you will  add in \\'aside\\' ? in \\'aside\\' you will  add topic which is completely different from your main page for eg. if you are  using google ads or facebook ads so there you can add.... you might have seen ads on websites so if you want to show ads on your website then you can use the \\'aside\\' tag and then comes the closing tag of main tag if you follow the layout which i told you so your page will be seo friendly the user experience in your page will boost up i already have told you the benefits of following this layout so whenever you are  creating a serious website this website not a serious one i am  just creating it to teach you if you are  creating a web-page for college fest or to collect information about your classmates or a group of your company if you are  doing stuff like this then it is not a serious website but if you are  starting a blog and you want to generate your living from that then thats a serious business so then you have to structure your website in this way if you are  creating an e-commerce website like flipkart or amazon or you are  creating a social network like facebook so it becomes mandatory for you to use the tags properly i wanted to write the \"amazon\" and after writing \"ama\" suggested me if you want websites like this so you want the search engines to understand your website so i have  written \"creating a page like this is not necessary\" but it creates a readable & structured layout just like i have  shown you and these type of pages are also seo friendly because when the computer is able to understand your page look, the google also want to index your page if you mention... lets suppose you are  trowing a party for the whole india and you said that whoever comes i will  provide the best party ever but how will the people know that you are  providing such part you must have to convey the information by any means just like that your page must contains some very obvious tags because when the things are obvious so you keep them in mind this person is throwing a party its very obvious or if you structure your page like this so its obvious that it is  your main content and it is  very obvious that this is a header and it contains a nav tag and nav tag contains some navigations like \"home\" \"about\" etc so i can easily recognize that you have  created this for navigation so the robot... or the computers.... or let us say web browser it is also a type of program it is not a human so if it is displaying your content so the additional information you have  provided which additional information? the exact position of your header, footer & main content so it can use this main information so your web browser will understand that we will  now move forward & discuss the link attributes i have  told you about the links and the links are.... let me write \"href=\"https://codewithharry.com\" i want to go to the codewithharry.com and let me write \"harrys website\" here so i have  written \"harrys website\" now look \"harrys website\" is written here let me zoom it in so you can see it if you click on \"harrys website\" so you will  be redirected to \"harrys website\" theres nothing new in it but if you add an attribute here and you write \"target = _main\" so look by writing \"target = _main\" this website will open in new tab so this type of attributes help you to add additional functionality so many tags provides many type of attributes and now if you click here and go to its mdn reference so you will  get to know more about anchor tag so look here is the information so whenever you want to gain more information about any tag so you can visit its mdn reference and there you can ready everything about that tag if you are  an advance user so you will  understand this but if you are  a beginner so do not  be scared they have given a little demo here so just look at it or i have  covered everything in notes & this video so theres is, was or will be nothing to be worries about and we are here to shoot all the tensions & troubles now look i have  told you about link attribute how to open in a new tab and i also have told you that we can put any content inside an anchor tag like images & headings for now i have  just added a text but if there was an image so you can also go to the \"codewithharry.com\" by clicking on that image so if i add an image here i will  do one thing i had an image..... this one so if i add this image here and let us say i rename it to \"cwh.jfif\" and then if i come back here and instead of this text if i add an image tag here if i something like this here i will  write \"< img src = \"cwh.jfif \" and in alt i will  write \"harrys website\" so i will  cut this and i will  save it and let me add width attribute \"width = 123\" and image have width & height both attributes we will  talk about this soon but the point i want highlight here let me show that first so if i click on this image so look i have  been redirected to \"codewithharry.com\" so it does not  matter if theres an image or a text you will  be redirected to the website in a new tab i hope that this was easy now if i also add height here let me take you to the note i have  written something \"if the page is inside the directory we need to make sure that we link to the correct page\" and i will  tell you about this and i will  also tell you about the image so these are the 2 things which we will  discuss so first lets understand the directory or let me first mention about the height of the image which is very important if you set both width & height of an image lets suppose if i make it is  height 34 so it is  aspect ratio will be disturbed now what is aspect ratio? let me show you this is the image with a disturbed aspect ratio which means if you have  created a website with a landscape image and the if you take that image in portrait mode with your phone and then you try to show that image  in a landscape mode so it is possible that your images aspect ratio will disturb so to avoid this we only set one the height or the width and then the second attribute is set automatically so if i only set the height so it will  keep the height 34 and the set the width automatically such that the aspect ration of this image  will not  be disturbed you read online more about aspect ratio and...... aspect ratio you can read about aspect ratio i hope 90% of you have understood this but if you are  in that 10% who do not  understand aspect ratio just google it, do not  think that you are  dumb everyone is weak at something it is better to gain knowledge about them asap now we will  move forward to the next one which i have  written here if a page is inside a directory we need to make sure that the link we are using is for the correct page\" what do i mean by this? as i have  used this \"cwh.jfif\" lets suppose this is inside a folder with name \"img\" suppose i have  moved all my images to the img folder let us say i am  using 100 images in this particular website and i do not  want a bundles of images here in my directory so i will  pack all the images in the img folder but there will be a problem this is saying that \"this is image does not  exist\" now if you inspect it then you will  be able to see \"failed to load\" which means you tried to use the \"cwh.jfif\" but we could not  find that why so? because \"cwh.jfif\" is not here now it is in the img folder so this is how yo have to add its url \"img/cwh.jfif\" which means in the img folder btw you can name this folder of your choice it is  not mandatory to name it \"img\" you can also name it \"harry\" io just named it \"img\" because i can easily recognize that it contains images and this error will be fixed so theres nothing to be worried about i just wanted to tell you because this is mostly used when you will  use frame work ...if you use flask, django, angular or view you will  have to face these things at the end of the day all these frame work renders html so we have  learned this and this and we have  learned that we can use img tag in anchor tag and we have  leaned that we can set only one attribute from the height & the width and the second one will be set automatically and we also have learned that we can use any one] from the single(\\'_\\') or double quote(\"_\") because it increase the consistency and you do not  want the other developers to remember you in bad terms you want them to remember you in good terms and you want to write a good code with the easiest way and if you are  maintaining the code on your own then it increase a reason to maintain it correctly now we will  talk about  would iv\\' and  would iv\\' tag used as a container for other elements what does it mean? we use  would iv\\' as a container sometimes we have to add some tags in a container for eg. let us say i have to pack a paragraph and a heading in a particular section lets suppose i am  creating another section and i have  to add different heading & paragraph lets suppose i have  to choose h1 and i will  write \"why love html\" and then i will  write a paragraph here i will  write \"html is a quite good language and it has turned my life upside-down\" i will  write something like this and any html developer who loves html will write this and then i will  write h1 \"why use boot starp\" lets suppose i write \"why use boot starp\" here and then if i write \"lorem12\" so i want to keep them separated it is possible that with the css..... what does  would iv\\' means? it means we have  divided this set of heading & paragraph so i have  divided this set of heading & paragraph this one is different and this one is different now if i want to increase it is  size then  i can do that with the css how we can increase that? if you do not  know css then give it a shot later i have  made videos on css for now just focus on html and i want this div to be of red color i am  showing you but do not  think that you ca not  do that i will  save this page and the changes will reflect automatically and let me reset it with (ctrl + scroll) now lets suppose i want to change the bg of this  would iv\\' to  are d\\' how am i doing this? you do not  have to be worried about i am  just adding the css just to show you how you can change the bg of a particular  would iv\\' i have  change a particular  would iv\\' bg to \\'purple\\' and another  would iv\\' to  are d\\' so this is how i can add styles and to add styles i have  divided them these 2 are together and these 2 are together now we will  talk about the in-line & block elements what is in-line element? and what is block element? in-line element is the element which occupies space according to it is  need for eg. if i want to put this sd card somewhere so it will  occupy space as per it needs and i can also put a mouse by it and i can put this pen by it too i can everything side by side but lets suppose if there was a rule that you cannot put sd card and other things in a same line this is the block element let me explain what i mean if i write a  would iv\\' here. let me show you a  would iv\\' and then i will  show you a span\\'  would iv\\' is a container and span\\' is also a container i will  write \"i am  a span tag here\" here and then i will  create another span\\' and in that i will  write \"i am  another span\" now see the difference between them now i will  inspect it and i already have told you that you can inspect by doing right click now i will  click on this arrow now see my  would iv\\' tag... this is the paragraph but i will  go to my  would iv\\' tag the  would iv\\' tag was inside the main tag i have  added that in section look how much this  would iv\\' should occupy space? only this much but it is occupying the whole space so  would iv\\' element or  would iv\\' like other element wherever they step-in the whole space belongs to them and span\\' is a like an innocent boy it only focus on it is  job and span\\' only occupy the space it needs i will  remove the paragraph from here because it is a block element and i will  only keep the span\\' paragraph is a block element & span\\' is an in-line element so span\\' will only occupy the space it needs you can see as i keep arrow on it so it is highlighting span\\' is only occupying this much space and theres another span\\' by it because span\\' is like an innocent boy which means it is an in-line element \"in-line\" contains 2 words \"in\" & \"line\" which means ins a single line so it is an in-line element and i will  mention here \" span\\' is an example of an in-line element \" and obviously i will  comment this out and then i will  write \"  would iv\\' is an example of a block element \" i will  comment this out too and look i am  using \" ctrl + / ) for commenting out it is a very simple shortcut so we have now learned in-line & block element so in chapter-3 we learned that there are 2 types of container  would iv\\' & span\\'  would iv\\' is an in-line element & span\\' is a block element i have  written this for you  would iv\\' tag is often used as a container for other elements  would iv\\' is a block level element span\\' is an in-line container which means it only occupies space it needs so we have  learned that span\\' tag is an in-line container and  would iv is a block level element block element means it occupies space more than it needs and in-line element means it only occupies space which is necessary you have to remember one thing if you add a block level container in an in-line container so the block level container will occupy the whole space so thats why i did not  add paragraph in span\\' and i added only text or you can also add any other in-line tag so guys as you can see i have  provided the list of in-line & block elements whatever we will  name these form elements after going to the backend pay close attention on my words so guys this is the time for us to discuss the search engine optimization in chapter-5 i have  explained briefly about the seo and if you are  a web developer then you must want to learn seo at any point of time let me tell you what i have  learned about seo in my life i will  tell you in very short term but it will  be very effective in my opinion using seo with-in a limit is good but seo is not about using is a website like... let me show you which type of website i am  talking about it is  not like if i open this website in a live server if you search for videos on google if i search videos on google so this website will never pop-up on the top now matter how much seo i have  done what is  the reason for that? relevance lets suppose you are  google and you have to rank the websites so if you have to rank the website then what would you do? if you have to rank the website then you will  curate the best websites and you want to show the website which is best suitable with the keyword lets assume that youtube community not  used the search engine optimization and on the internet you search for \"youtube\" so what do you think if you have created a website like youtube & done the seo without providing any value do you think that your website will pop-up on the top while searching for the youtube definitely not so search engine optimization is a way to improve the existing ranking a lil-bit pay close attention i will  rather say seo is the way to help search engine finding your website so at maximum you can just specify the google about your website & it is  content if you have  made an excellent website on internet and then you think that your website will pop-up on the top and you have  also written a good content so the search engines like google, bing & yahoo also ask about your website, its content & description like \"codewithharry.com\" is a website this website is about who? if someone search for \"fires\" so this description is most important for the user who is searching for the fire so search engines always ask you about the description like this one so it will  be easy for us to show this page and if you tell about the title so it will  be easy for us to show your page title here and the users will be valued who are coming to search website on the search engines so the very first thing for the seo is... in my opinion it did not  even include in course seo to provide the value in actual how much useful is your content? if a website is actually useful i will  show you if i search for \"bill gates blog\" so do you think this search is optimized properly? yes the optimization has taken place but if a blog is related to a particular person you may have seen some websites in which people make a very basic page in html after all that those website pop-up on the top reason being \"relevance\" because those website contains the content which user actually searched for i  will not  explain more about seo i only have included seo in chapter-5 that is necessary for you to learn if you are  learning the html we will  focus only on html stand point of seo we  will not  dive to depth of the seo because it includes a lot of things we will not be looking in to keyword building in content optimization aspect of seo how we do keyword building? how we do content optimization writing content according to \"which content is being search for how many time\" this also comes under seo but... we  will not  focus on that aspect we will  look for the existing which already have written how to add seo in that page how can we improve the ranking of that website by adding more html tags & optimization and not by any illegal means we will  actually provide value to our users and how will we do that? we will  shorten it is  loading time. if a page is taking 10 sec to be load that, google might not show that on the top and on the other if a page is taking fraction of a sec to load definitely google will show that on the top now lets talk about types of seos we have  got 2 types of seos the first one is the on-page seo and the second one is the off-page seo we will  talk about on-page seo which can be done by html developers and what does off-page seo means? off-page seo means you have  to do link building many people says theres no advantage of link building let me tell you the meaning if link building if another website is linked to your website for eg. if i point on a website lets suppose if i have  added a url of my facebook page so there are many people who are pointing on facebook so search engines will recognize that many people are pointing on this website so it must contain something important so this is called link building this comes under off-page but i will  only talk about on-page which can be done by html developers and in on-page seo you can do seo through html html developer can implement seo using following techniques we will  talk about some techniques and again this not a  comprehensive right to seo which means it is  not like if you learn this then you have  completed seo i will  make a course for seo in future but i just wanted to add a chapter in which you can know that how to so seo the first technique i want to tell you is \"it is set the title very nice & to the point\" add a very nice & to the point title and then set a meta description add a description meta tag and why should we have to add a nice title? because title is the main thing which is shown in the search if you come across a good title so theres high chances that you will  click on that because the very step is to click on to the website and if you will  only read the content when you will  find it useful if you do not  click on the website and your website does not  have ctr (click through rate) so what is  the use for that? so thats why the click is important now this website is taking too long to load or theres something wrong with my internet if theres some problem in site then this site might be loosing on.... ...you know... ...on traffic because it is working too slow look this website has been loaded lets have a look on another page this is also loaded look this website is not working but now this works sometimes when website gets slow so they stop working so google remove them from the first page this type of pop-ups are also not a good signs for good user experience but again people create this because they get the incentive anyways... we  will not  talk about them much meta description sets the meta description meta description means that you have to add a meta tag let me tell you how to add meta tag and lets open this folder in vscode and obviously i will  close the other folder and i will  make a file with the name \"seo.html\" and obviously i will  add a boiler plate code in it and here i will  write \"s-e-o\" and then lets say i will  add a header here and then i will  add a nav tag and then i will  add \"ul\" and then \"li\" and then i will  write \"home\" in it and similarly i will  add \"about\" after \"home\" and lets say this is how i am  creating my website \"about\"...... and after \"about\" i will  write \"contact\" so a basic website always contains \"home\" \"about\" \"contact\" now lets say i am  adding a section\\' in its main content & after that lets say i am  adding a  would iv\\' in it and i am  adding a paragraph in a container in which i have  added \"lorem34\" which i have  added some sample text and let me show you this website in live server and this is our website and i will  close all these links and look this is how my website is looking now let us say that i want to add meta tag in this website look i already have added the title now if i only add seo in it let us say i am  talking about seo this is not at all an appropriate title because if you are  talking about the seo then write this in this way \"seo: a beginners guide\" seo in 2021: a beginners guide \"seo in 2022: a beginners guide\" so if someone search for \"how will seo change in 2021\" and your article is providing information for that content so theres high chance that the user will click on that so your page must contain very click-able title & the content related to your title this page does not  contain anything about seo i am  just taking an example & it is  not like that you can write anything and your page will pop on the top i have  written this & now we will  add meta tag here now look theres already a meta tag for \"view port\" i will  write \"meta\" & then \"desc\" and then i will  write about seo seo is like... suppose i will  write anything ...this is a nice article on seo i know that i have  written this for no reason but you can write good content in 80-100 words and if you have  written more then google will chop it off theres nothing to be worried about if you have  written seo which is a very competitive as you can see \"seo stands for....\" they must have added this in their meta tag now look, if i open this website then theres high chance that they must have added met description and you can see that they have added meta tag for description we have  got a lot of types of meta tags but you must set the meta tag for description theres no guarantee about your content displaying here as is it google will use your meta description only when it will  find it usable i am  telling you this with my experience, i have  noticed this from all the websites which i build & appeared on google now \"set a nice url slug\" what does this mean? look, whenever you are  working with a backend lets suppose if you are  using flask, django or php so you must name your page that so when someone look at it... just as they have given \"seo\" you have to name it in a way that if someone share your url then the receiver can easily recognize what is contains if i give you an url \"boss.com/learn/seo/this\" what will be your reaction? you will  ask what it is? you will  say \"yes! this may contain information about seo\" but what information about seo? but if i give you a url \"what-is-seo\" \"what-is-seo\" so you will  say \" yes ! they have mentioned about seo in url\" theres 99% chance that this url is telling us more about \"what is seo\" so we will  need a good slug a url slug is like \"what-is-seo\" so we will  name a goof url slug that anyone can tell what does this url contains just by looking at that so if google or any other search engine will index your page so it will  tell that \"yes! if this man has set it is  slug nicely so it definitely want to help the people\" this man is not here to earn google ranking but to help the people for real so google notices this and we have  done \"set the meta description\" & \"set the nice url slug\" now add the meta tag for keywords many people do not  add the meta tag for keywords you can either do or do not  but it depends many people says that the meta tag of keywords is treated as a span\\' but this is how you can dd keywords meta tag and i have  told you i will  write \"meta name = keyword\" and then \" content = seo, search, seo 2021 \" so this is how you can set keywords but many people says that this practice is not good enough this increase the spam\\' and people make the keywords tough so this is how you can add meta tag for keywords so in actual people have abused this \"meta name = keywords\" more than using it and people started adding more than enough keywords in their pages which was an unfair practice so the search engines started discouraging this and they have decided not to use \"meta name = keyword\" at all so this came to light and theres no mdn link for \"meta name = keywords\" if you hover on it then you will  find no mdn link you will  find for meta element but not for \"meta name = keywords\" and this is reason that even mdn community has denied this so i wanted to tell you this about keyword description so do not set the meta keyword tags because people have abused that and even if you add sweet keyboard stag if you add a small tag with 2-3 keyword then it is not a problem in my opinion so the next point is to set the meta author tag and we have to set the meta author tag because if you are writing a blog then you must want to mention about the author and your users will also want to know about the author because maybe they are interested in reading the content of their favourite author and then we will  move to \"set a fav icon\" and let me tell you what is fav icon i will  visit the \"fav icon generator\" and look they are telling how you can make your fav icon suppose that i am  visiting this website & i have  downloaded a fav icon so after downloading i will  unzip it & i will  do \"extract to fav icon\" and you can see it has given me some icons and i can use them as a fav icon so i will  copy \"favicon.ico\" file and after copying i want to use it here so i will  open this folder and i will  write \"reveal in file explorer\" and i will  paste it here and then i will  go to \"link fav icon\" and i will  write \"favicon.icon\" now my icon would appear here when i press (ctrl + shift + r) so look my fav icon has appeared here so this is called fav icon you can use this website or any other website thee are a lot of them which helps you to create fav icon now look they have provided different options like bg color now i want to add some padding here because i think the text is quite close with the boundaries but again you can use another fav icon and for that you can use fav icon generator or adobe photo shop thats up to you. but once you got the \\'.ico file\\' so this is how yo can set it so i hope you got the point and there were an error in my pages that the fav icon was not  appearing but that error has been fixed now so if you set the fav icon in this way then it will  provide a good user experience and user will find that he is on a genuine website which is good now the next point is \"compress images & other resources\" if you write image compressor so you will  find some image compressing website on internet in which you can upload your image and compress them which means you can lower their size without having to lose a lot of quality your image quality does get low when you compress them but there are some compressions which can give you great compression by decreasing minimum quality it is possible that your 25 mb image may turn to 2 mb and you do not  have to pay a lot of loss in quality now lets suppose if you are  displaying your 100 mb image in just this small portion so theres no point in that and there are high chances that you can optimize it so you have to use things like this so upload your files on it and download the compressed file and use them and then there comes \"minify & compress\" you can minify & compress all of these javascript, css & html and there are a lot of tools look heres a website that you can upload your js or css file here and it will  minimize in actual so i will  write a sample css i will  write.... \"background:red\" and then i will  close it in this way and when i will  minify it so look it has removed all the spaces & new lines if a bigger css files contains a lot of spaces so size of that file will increase and this website remove all of them and when we write html or css code in this format we add more spaces & new lines because we have to increase the readability we do the format document to increase the readability so that when we or our fellow programmer read this code or tries to improve this code so he  will not  find this code difficult to read & rubbish so we want to avoid these type of things but when computer read this file so you can give a compressed file which means you can remove these new lines & extra spaces so this is what these tools does so you have to minify your html, css & js file so you will  find a boost in seo and your load time will also decrease because you were loading the file of 100 mb at that time and now you are  loading the file of just 2 mb so definitely your load time will decrease so compressing the image decrease your load time and the benefit of minifying & compressing the html, css & js files is that you are  not downloading the extra files and after this \"add alt text to images\" i have  told yo about an alt attribute in which if an image is failed to load so a text will be displayed and it is  a good practice because if your image failed to load then you will  will see an alt text and if it also help the blind peoples who come to read the content on your website so the devices read the alt text to explain them the topic of your image so i hope you got the point and you have  learned the html i will  provide all the chapter in a zip file as they are and also access the notes & codes and many people ask for all the chapter in 1 pdf file but you can use a tool name \"merge tool\" but i will  add a \"merge.pdf\" in which you will  get all the chapters merged so i will  add that too i hope you have  understood the html and in future i will  upload a course for css with notes and please do tell in the comments if you want that too and in that we will  learn how to make websites we will  learn to create good websites templates and css i hope this video we will  will teach you html perfectly so thats it for this video guys and if you want to move ahead then you can watch my css playlist and i have  also made a lot of projects for web development i have  made some advance project for web development and i also have made games using html, css and js and i will  soon upload a video for css so you can also wait for that so i hope you have  enjoyed this video an if you do then please tell me in the comments thats it for this video guys thank you so much guys for watching this video :) and i will  see you next time'"

       "'we  will not  talk about them much meta description sets the meta description meta description means that you have to add a meta tag let me tell you how to add meta tag and lets open this folder in vscode and obviously i will  close the other folder and i will  make a file with the name \"seo.html\" and obviously i will  add a boiler plate code in it and here i will  write \"s-e-o\" and then lets say i will  add a header here and then i will  add a nav tag and then i will  add \"ul\" and then \"li\" and then i will  write \"home\" in it and similarly i will  add \"about\" after \"home\" and lets say this is how i am  creating my website \"about\"...... and after \"about\" i will  write \"contact\" so a basic website always contains \"home\" \"about\" \"contact\" now lets say i am  adding a section\\' in its main content & after that lets say i am  adding a  would iv\\' in itso span\\' will only occupy the space it needs you can see as i keep arrow on it so it is highlighting span\\' is only occupying this much space and theres another span\\' by it because span\\' is like an innocent boy which means it is an in-line element \"in-line\" contains 2 words \"in\" & \"line\" which means ins a single line so it is an in-line element and i will  mention here \" span\\' is an example of an in-line element \" and obviously i will  comment this out and then i will  write \"  would iv\\' is an example of a block element \" i will  comment this out too and look i am  using \" ctrl + / ) for commenting out it is a very simple shortcut so we have now learned in-line & block element so in chapter-3 we learned that there are 2 types of container  would iv\\' & span\\'  would iv\\' is an in-line element & span\\' is a block element i have  written this for you  would iv\\' tag is often used as a container for other elements  would iv\\' is a block level element span\\' is an in-line container which means it only occupies space it needs so we have  learned that span\\' tag is an in-line container and  would iv is a block level element block element means it occupies space more than it needs and in-line element means it only occupies space which is necessary you have to remember one thing if you add a block level container in an in-line container so the block level container will occupy the whole space so thats why i did not  add paragraph in span\\' and i added only text or you can also add any other in-line tagyou must ask these type of questions from yourselves when you do that \"create a page with 5 wallpaper images taken from the internet\" you have to take 5 wallpapers from the internet and you have to display them and if i search for wallpaper then to the images and if you only want to display them so you can find a lot of wallpaper images look we have  got a lot of wallpaper images so you can use any wallpaper from this it does not  matter which wallpaper you will  use if i use this wallpaper i will  do right click > open image in new tab and i will  copy the url of this image and take this so you just have to choose any wallpaper from these wallpaper & you have to display it and you have to solve this question on your own i am  not going to solve this the reason is... you should have knowledge about how to do this because i already have shown many examples and the third question is to \"use br & hr tags to display a piece of text with line bricks\" try this question too on your own because i want to keep this video short & to the point thats why i have  given questions for the practice so that you can do practice on your own the forth question is \"try the following equation using html\" you have  to write this equation from html (  c  +  o₂  ➜  co₂  )we will  click right --> view page source and we will  copy this and paste it here i have  simply pasted it i am  telling you the website  will not  look 100% good because there are styles which i am  using through sever roots for now we  will not  discuss this we will  just keep in mind that it is  not this easy to view page source of any website copied it is  code and paste it in a notepad and we can copy that website, it is  not possible but maybe it is possible lets have a look, so i have  saved it i have  opened it with notepad by clicking rightlets guess what tag will it be this is definitely a heading tag you can inspect it and it will be the h1 tag this is the primary heading of this page so this will be h1 tag lets suppose if you  will not  find this h1 in any page so the developer of that page has made a mistake because if you have not  use the heading tag even in your heading so theres something wrong with your page your page can be displayed using the css without using the heading tags but it will  not be called best practice you have to do this with a good practice if you use best software techniques for building website or apps then you will  get advantages i just want to tell you this now i will  close this because our chapter-2 practice set has been completed i have  also hand picked some question so that you can do your practice after completing the chapter-2 i just want to keep these notes as if you have these notes & this video then whenever you will  turn the page you will  remember everything and i also have given practice so that if you ever have to do revision then you just have to turn some pages now we will  move to the chapter-3 and in chapter-3 we will  learn how we can structure a website because if you learn how to structure a website then you can easily create any type of websiteso this is how yo have to add its url \"img/cwh.jfif\" which means in the img folder btw you can name this folder of your choice it is  not mandatory to name it \"img\" you can also name it \"harry\" io just named it \"img\" because i can easily recognize that it contains images and this error will be fixed so theres nothing to be worried about i just wanted to tell you because this is mostly used when you will  use frame work ...if you use flask, django, angular or view you will  have to face these things at the end of the day all these frame work renders html so we have  learned this and this and we have  learned that we can use img tag in anchor tag and we have  leaned that we can set only one attribute from the height & the width and the second one will be set automatically and we also have learned that we can use any one] from the single(\\'_\\') or double quote(\"_\") because it increase the consistency and you do not  want the other developers to remember you in bad terms you want them to remember you in good terms and you want to write a good code with the easiest way and if you are  maintaining the code on your own then it increase a reason to maintain it correctly now we will  talk about  would iv\\' and  would iv\\' tag used as a container for other elements what does it mean?so i can zoom it like this so to learn all these things we use vscode or i will  say to enjoy these features we use vscode because we got a lot of things in vscode and theres nothing in notepad to change the font size you have to press a lot keys so thats why we  will not  use notepad but we can definitely use notepad we just have to understand how to do things now we will  move to the chapter-1 where we will  create our first website we will  learn different kind of things and learn about \"index.html\" and we will  learn about we page structure what is a basic web page structure lets move to chapter-1 now so guys we will  now move to chapter-1 firstly we will  open this and the chapter-1 is \"creating pour first website\" which will tell us how we can create our website so before starting this let me tell you that every website is made up of html and we start building a website by creating a file named \"index.html\" so i will  open my vscode and my vscode is opened in this folder in which folder?\"....just press the \\'enter\\' and i will  see the rest\" emmet is so good there are very few people like emmet in this world just write \"h1\" and then \"list of books\" you have  written \"list of books\" or i will  write \"books to read\" \"books to read\" i will  write whatever the heading i want to add and then i will  write \"p\" and then i will  write \"there are a lot of books to read for you\" and now i will  save it and then i will  open it with live server & you know what will happen and it will  open in liver server and then i will  be able too see this heading & paragraph so look i have  written an opening tag & a closing tag & then a content in between what is meant by content?and i will  open this chapter 0 pdf here and as you can see i have  written \"chapter 0 introduction\" html = hypertext markup language and html is the language of the web it is used to create websites if you ever visited a website lets suppose \"www.codewithharry.com\" if you ever visit a website and then you go to \"view page source\" so you will  be able to see the actual source of this website you will  be able to see how this website was made what are thing which was used in frontend which type of tags they have used and now if you do not  know about html then maybe you will  find these tags over-whelming but let me tell you, i am  going to make these things very easy for you all so we have  lean about full from of html it is hypertext markup language this is the language of the web which means you will  need this ...if you want to display beautiful web pages it is used to create websites we use html tags to define look & feel of a website to define the look & feel of a website we use the html for eg.i will  open this same folder in the vscode because this is the chapter-2s practice set i will  create a file here with a name \"chater_2_practice_set\" or \"practice_set.html\" i will  add boiler plate code and i will  name it \"chapter 2 practice set\" and in the body i am  going to add the code from which we are going to solve this question so if i want to add a primary heading so it definitely will be h1 and lets suppose i am  writing about the mountains and after that.... let us say, i am  adding the secondary heading and i am  writing \"why mountains\" and let us say i have  written a paragraph which contains 45 words and i will  turn on the word wrapso the search engines started discouraging this and they have decided not to use \"meta name = keyword\" at all so this came to light and theres no mdn link for \"meta name = keywords\" if you hover on it then you will  find no mdn link you will  find for meta element but not for \"meta name = keywords\" and this is reason that even mdn community has denied this so i wanted to tell you this about keyword description so do not set the meta keyword tags because people have abused that and even if you add sweet keyboard stag if you add a small tag with 2-3 keyword then it is not a problem in my opinion so the next point is to set the meta author tag and we have to set the meta author tag because if you are writing a blog then you must want to mention about the author and your users will also want to know about the author because maybe they are interested in reading the content of their favourite author and then we will  move to \"set a fav icon\" and let me tell you what is fav icon i will  visit the \"fav icon generator\" and look they are telling how you can make your fav icon suppose that i am  visiting this website & i have  downloaded a fav icon so after downloading i will  unzip it & i will  do \"extract to fav icon\" and you can see it has given me some icons and i can use them as a fav iconand i am  adding a paragraph in a container in which i have  added \"lorem34\" which i have  added some sample text and let me show you this website in live server and this is our website and i will  close all these links and look this is how my website is looking now let us say that i want to add meta tag in this website look i already have added the title now if i only add seo in it let us say i am  talking about seo this is not at all an appropriate title because if you are  talking about the seo then write this in this way \"seo: a beginners guide\" seo in 2021: a beginners guide \"seo in 2022: a beginners guide\" so if someone search for \"how will seo change in 2021\" and your article is providing information for that content so theres high chance that the user will click on that so your page must contain very click-able title & the content related to your title this page does not  contain anything about seothis is big or this is small i will  add the \"small\" in \"this is small\" this is small and as you can see i have  got big & small of different size and now after this we will  talk about how you can add a horizontal divider in html theres and  tag for it as i am  explaining you these topics just as i explained the topic of heading & paragraph i will  write \"heading & paragraph\" and i will  comment it out and after heading 7 paragraph i explained you about links i want that i will  separate them with a horizontal line and then i explained you about the image tagyou do not  have to be worried about i am  just adding the css just to show you how you can change the bg of a particular  would iv\\' i have  change a particular  would iv\\' bg to \\'purple\\' and another  would iv\\' to  are d\\' so this is how i can add styles and to add styles i have  divided them these 2 are together and these 2 are together now we will  talk about the in-line & block elements what is in-line element?we add a forward slash(/) and we write the name of that tag which means  and it becomes a closing tag we will  open & close all the tags in the way in html we will  create html elements here i will  click right > open with code and this folder has been opened in vscode so now look i have  opened this folder in vscode now we will  create a website here and the name for html page will be \"index.html\" for obvious reasons now i will  add an exclamation mark(!)whenever the search engines like google will read your page so they will  think.. ...that you are  writing the most important heading in the h1 and after that as you are  using the h2, h3, h4.... you are  decreasing the importance which means if you have  used the h1 for \"books to read\" so the search engine will think or any bot whos crawling your website will think that the h1 is the primary topic of your page so you have to use the h1.....h6 tags very wisely if you want the search engine optimization and if you want to convey your pages content easily with any bot, crawler or a search engine so use the tag wisely you never have to use the h1-h6 tags to define the sizes of the headings i have  seen some people who learned the html recently use the h1-h6 tags in a way to define the sizes of the heading for eg.let us say i have to pack a paragraph and a heading in a particular section lets suppose i am  creating another section and i have  to add different heading & paragraph lets suppose i have  to choose h1 and i will  write \"why love html\" and then i will  write a paragraph here i will  write \"html is a quite good language and it has turned my life upside-down\" i will  write something like this and any html developer who loves html will write thisi am  just taking an example & it is  not like that you can write anything and your page will pop on the top i have  written this & now we will  add meta tag here now look theres already a meta tag for \"view port\" i will  write \"meta\" & then \"desc\" and then i will  write about seo seo is like... suppose i will  write anything ...this is a nice article on seoif you do not  know css then give it a shot later i have  made videos on css for now just focus on html and i want this div to be of red color i am  showing you but do not  think that you ca not  do that i will  save this page and the changes will reflect automatically and let me reset it with (ctrl + scroll) now lets suppose i want to change the bg of this  would iv\\' to  are d\\' how am i doing this?no, you can change the bg color through css but with javascript you can even control that with javascript you can choose to hide or show anything & for as many minutes as you like with the help of javascript we will  learn all these things and you know these things will be in their place when i will  reload the page now lets have a look on a beautiful analogy which i have  written this is a very good analogy thats why i refer it as \"beautiful\" if html is your cars body let us assume you are a car manufacturer if you are not, then just assume and now i will  search for a video on youtube which is related to car manufacturing and i have  got a video related to car manufacturing now look at these cars look at their unpainted body just take those bodies as html and now if i paint this and make some designs... add some designed lights in it tail lights, head lamps and add a good wind shield and make it like that everyone who see this will be amazed by its design for now no one will be amazed by this cars design there are cars, like sport cars you will  be amazed by their design so if you see those type of cars the first one is its frame along with that they have designed it so just like that with html you design the frame of your website and then you design it with the cssi have  explained briefly about the seo and if you are  a web developer then you must want to learn seo at any point of time let me tell you what i have  learned about seo in my life i will  tell you in very short term but it will  be very effective in my opinion using seo with-in a limit is good but seo is not about using is a website like... let me show you which type of website i am  talking about it is  not like if i open this website in a live server if you search for videos on google if i search videos on googleso whenever you want to gain more information about any tag so you can visit its mdn reference and there you can ready everything about that tag if you are  an advance user so you will  understand this but if you are  a beginner so do not  be scared they have given a little demo here so just look at it or i have  covered everything in notes & this video so theres is, was or will be nothing to be worries about and we are here to shoot all the tensions & troubles now look i have  told you about link attribute how to open in a new tab and i also have told you that we can put any content inside an anchor tag like images & headings for now i have  just added a text but if there was an image so you can also go to the \"codewithharry.com\" by clicking on that imagebut i want you do this on your own because if you inspect a website so first take away you will  get is... ...that you will  learn to change your favourite websites and that can be any website i will  change the \"codewithharry\" website so now we are on \"codewithhary.com\" and i will  show you changing this by the way i already did that one time before lets suppose i want to change \"contact me\" and i want to change it to... \"contact this person\" so this is how i can change this and make sure to try this on your own try to change it it is  not important to change this website and i know that 90% of you will change \"codewithhary\" try another website you can change anything or you can also use \"codewithhary try to change your favourite website it is very fun when the web page is changed very few people are familiar with that and those who know is good for theirselves go to your favourite website & try to view the page source and write the exact lines of code does it clone the website?it is called boiler plate code boiler plate code of html will appear here and i will  create it with a name \"chapter-3\" now what i will  do is... as i have  told you about a header tag i have  used a header tag here and then i will  use a main tag here and then i will  add a paragraph here and i will  write \"this is the main content\" and after pressing ( ctrl + enter )and i have  also opened the chapter-2s pdf it does not  matter we have  learned a lot of things we learned about big, small, pre, subscript & superscript tags and i think it was fun because we have  learned how to build a website now what we will  do is, we will  do some questions so that you can hold tight on to the html and you can understand better about whatever the tags, properties & attribute we have  learned so the first question is, \"create an html page with a heading\" which is going to be the title of the pagebecause you want that traffic must hit your website if you are  a blogger or you provide any type of service so you want the traffic on your website and you want the people to come on your website & appreciate your hard work so we have learned about the se index and now we will  move back to the chapter-3 notes and we will  learn how to use these 3 tags so we add navigation bar in the header and we add nav tag in it and in in main tags we add \"section\" article\" & \"aside\" tag and these three tags are most commonly used tags you can add \"div\" here we will  learn more about \"div\" later but these 3 are the most important tags which you must have knowledge about these are the opening & closing tags of main tag basically we have  talked about header, footer & main tag\"this is bold\" \"this is italic\" & \"this is underline\" appeared in a single line which means if i add a new line here even then this new line  will not  be displayed as you can see new line has not been displayed and i have  even saved the page so even if i add multiple new lines, that  will not  effect it\" or if i add some extra spaces.. look how many extra i have  added here here i have  written \"this is      italic\" and what does rendered here?i do not  know why you can write javascript here i will  tell you how these things actually works so i will  open my javascript console where i can write my javascript and here i will  quickly write \"document.body.style.backgroundcolor = \"red\" ; i repeat i have  written this line which says.... turn the bodys background  are d\\' and look as i press the \"enter\" as i inject the javascript, this turns  are d\\' and how to perform these things?i will  move downward and after \"main\" i will  create a footer with and as you will  create these tags vscode will completely support you by \"support\" i means that whenever you will  write something it will  auto-complete it if you put you arrow won any particular tag so it will  provide you a link for mdn reference so it will  become very easy for you to understand things and to do to the reference of a particular tagso i hope this practice set was very beneficial for you and you have  understood this easily now we will  move to chapter-2 where we will  learn about some basic tags i will  see you in chapter-2 so guys we are now on chapter-2 in which we will  learn about some basic tags and we will  use those tags to create some websites so i will  quickly open the chapter-2yes the optimization has taken place but if a blog is related to a particular person you may have seen some websites in which people make a very basic page in html after all that those website pop-up on the top reason being \"relevance\" because those website contains the content which user actually searched for i  will not  explain more about seo i only have included seo in chapter-5 that is necessary for you to learn if you are  learning the html we will  focus only on html stand point of seo we  will not  dive to depth of the seo because it includes a lot of things we will not be looking in to keyword building in content optimization aspect of seo how we do keyword building?so you will  find a boost in seo and your load time will also decrease because you were loading the file of 100 mb at that time and now you are  loading the file of just 2 mb so definitely your load time will decrease so compressing the image decrease your load time and the benefit of minifying & compressing the html, css & js files is that you are  not downloading the extra files and after this \"add alt text to images\" i have  told yo about an alt attribute in which if an image is failed to load so a text will be displayed and it is  a good practice because if your image failed to load then you will  will see an alt text and if it also help the blind peoples who come to read the content on your website so the devices read the alt text to explain them the topic of your imagelook here, this have been rendered and as soon as i save this page it is displaying the changes automatically after reloading by the way this is not a work of html this is the work if live server live server is an extension which reflects the changes when you save your files every time i build my website template i always use the live server this extension was made  greatly in vscode now we have  understood \"a tag is like a container\" your html document is nothing more than this it is just a piece of code whatever website you see on your daily basis just like if you are  seeing my website the actual website is not this one but this one this is the source code it is  about the code and not about the images or red colored button or anything it contains your website transports in the form of this code in actual this code gets transported and then as soon as your browser gets this code it renders this code in this form so the code is provided to the browser through server and browser renders the code in this form which you usually see so now lets understand, as soon as your browser gets this html document so your browser plays a major role in converting this code to a viewable formor i will  say a good enough website so we are going to learn more about this we can add elements inside the body tag to define the page layout i will  talk about html element what do i mean by html element html elements means an opening tag & a closing tag whenever we write an html tag we write 2 tags \"opening tag & closing tag\" and the content in between this content can be a text or more opening & closing tags so thats why i have  written this as content i can also write this as  then any headingso you want the search engines to understand your website so i have  written \"creating a page like this is not necessary\" but it creates a readable & structured layout just like i have  shown you and these type of pages are also seo friendly because when the computer is able to understand your page look, the google also want to index your page if you mention... lets suppose you are  trowing a party for the whole india and you said that whoever comes i will  provide the best party ever but how will the people know that you are  providing such part you must have to convey the information by any means just like that your page must contains some very obvious tags because when the things are obvious so you keep them in mind this person is throwing a party its very obvious or if you structure your page like thisbut i will  only talk about on-page which can be done by html developers and in on-page seo you can do seo through html html developer can implement seo using following techniques we will  talk about some techniques and again this not a  comprehensive right to seo which means it is  not like if you learn this then you have  completed seo i will  make a course for seo in futurebut we were unable to copy it 100% look here, this is different & this is different we will  also understand its reason and we will  understand its reason briefly in the upcoming chapters but for now just remember you do not  have to download anything look the images are missing from here style sheets took some time to be downloaded it is working, but some images are missing but again if you click on a blog so it is not working so the conclusion is... you can copy the website but not 100% it is  not that easy to copy the website now if you have understanding so you can do, it is  not that difficult but it is  not that easy because...and i will  click on \"finish\" and if you follow every step and if you have installed the vscode as i told you and if you right click here so you will  find an option here \"open with code\" we command it to show this option when we were installing the vscode click on \"open with code\" and after that you will  see all the files of this directory here not here but here and you can create a new file by click here and create a new folder by clicking here if you are  using vscode for the first time then do not  be scared because you will  get used to once you use itin the closing tags so it will  think that you have  only written this much after the \\'href\\' so it will  be confused and can also give a syntax error so if you are  using the double quotes (\" \") in your attributes content so remember to use single quotes(\\' \\') in the outer and vice versa if you are  using the single quotes(\\' \\') in attribute so use the double quotes (\" \") or else you can use anyone from the single quotes(\\' \\') & double quotes (\" \") but in the end, i will  advice you to maintain the consistency.and if i press the \"tab\" key & write here \"go to about\" so it will  try to visit the \"about.html\" i will  create an \"about.html\" here i will  change the title with \"about\" and i will  write \"lorem45\" by writing a paragraph and then i will  write \"this is about\" a very simple thing from \"index.html\" as i click on \"go to about\" so look i have  been redirected to \"about.html\" this is the relative linkit is asking you you have to add \"href = https://codewithharry.com\" and then write the content \"click here to go to harrys website\" suppose you have  written something like this now when you look at it you will  found a link on \"click here to go to harrys website\" and when you click on it you will  be redirected to \"codewithharry.com\" so what is the \\'href\\' written with the anchor tag in actual \\'href\\' is a link to a website and it will  open whenever you will  click on this textso what do you think if you have created a website like youtube & done the seo without providing any value do you think that your website will pop-up on the top while searching for the youtube definitely not so search engine optimization is a way to improve the existing ranking a lil-bit pay close attention i will  rather say seo is the way to help search engine finding your website so at maximum you can just specify the google about your website & it is  content if you have  made an excellent website on internet and then you think that your website will pop-up on the top and you have  also written a good content so the search engines like google, bing & yahoo also ask about your website, its content & description like \"codewithharry.com\" is a website this website is about who?so i hope you got the point and there were an error in my pages that the fav icon was not  appearing but that error has been fixed now so if you set the fav icon in this way then it will  provide a good user experience and user will find that he is on a genuine website which is good now the next point is \"compress images & other resources\" if you write image compressor so you will  find some image compressing website on internet in which you can upload your image and compress them which means you can lower their size without having to lose a lot of quality your image quality does get low when you compress them but there are some compressions which can give you great compression by decreasing minimum quality it is possible that your 25 mb image may turn to 2 mb and you do not  have to pay a lot of loss in quality now lets suppose if you are  displaying your 100 mb image in just this small portion so theres no point in thator \\'.html\\' extension\" along with \".html\" we can also use \".htm\" extension if we do not  add \"l\" in \".html\" if we are lazy and we do not  want to type the whole \"html\" but we only want to type \"htm\" so you are  welcome you can do that too your templates will work but i want to give you a disclaimer sometimes.....let me show you the live server is unable to detect the \"index.htm\" it detects \"index.html\" as a starting page but if you open the \"index.htm\" so you will  get this page totally rendered which means we mostly have to use \".html\" extension and we do not  have to use \".htm\"\"this.txt\" and you can write anything here this is some content on this file save it and after this you have to click here in you extension tab and after that you have to install an extension which is \"live server\" now many of you are using this very first time and you do not  have any idea about \"live server\" just install this \"live server\" \"installing....\" and it is now installed now as you can see \"live server\" has been installed and i can open any file with \"live server\" let me show you the file we created \"cwh.html\" if i right click on this file and click on \"open with live server\" look i will  click on this & it is asking me something and i will  cancel it and after this look, it will  create a live server for me it creates a server like a website and then display all the files you can open it directly with double click on these files but this method is recommended because this creates a web server for you and if you are using web server so the advantage of using a web server is...css i have  discuss briefly more about this in chapter 0 where i have  explained this with another analogy but now we will  understand the difference between the backend & frontend and how does a basic website works whenever a web browser request \"www.codewithhary.com\" from a web server so in return web server send the files of html, css and js your browser parce these html, css and js files and show you what you actually see in a website actually it was codes but your browser parce that in such a manner that a beautiful website is visible to you i have  divided this video in 5 chapters where i have  provided a practice set with each chapter so that you can practice itthose are its children now i will  show you one thing very interesting from the vscode now if you click on the left side of \"the head\" so look they have collapsed and now they have expanded collapse-expend, collapse-expend so now look the html contains the head & the body understand this in a way that html have 2 children \"head\" & \"body\" so when html have 2 children \"head\" & \"body: so html is obviously the father of \"head\" & \"body\" this is simple man, please do not  say that you did not  understood this this is very simple thing so html is the parent of \"head\" & \"body\" and what is the relation between \"head\" & \"body\" they are \"siblings\" , this is the exact word we use \"head\" & \"body\" are siblings now look here i have  written this \"head & body are the children tags of html tags\" in the same way \"h1\" & \"paragraph\" are the children of?so i hope you got the point \"how to display an html document\" now lets talk about the important notes i have  written some things here which are important \"head and body tags are children of html tags\" so look, you can see your whole code in a way like this first you have  specified your doc-type that your doc-type will be html you will  find the first tag very unique in compare to the other tags and then our main html page starts we have  written html here and where is its closing tag?\"xu-a compatible\" is used for the microsofts old browsers compatibility and \"view port\" is used to change the initial scale there are more tags similar to these 2 tags which we can use to build our website but first of all we will  learn about some most important tags in html body contains all the tags which you will  see on this web page the tags which are displayed are present in the body now look here, i have  mentioned this in notes \"the main body of the page rendered by the browser\" this is the tag visible here and then i have  added a paragraph tag and a heading tagresponsive means if you use this website in any device so it looks good it is  not like if you a build  website for just phones and if you are  opening that in a computer so it is creating problem responsive means that your website is adaptive to all devices so nowadays responsiveness is must for websites if any client ask you to build website so he  will not  specify you 10 years ago responsiveness was an extra feature it was count as an extra feature provided by a good programmer but nowadays it is a necessity not an option 10 years ago it was optional nowadays internet is used more in phones as compare to computersbut if you are  in that 10% who do not  understand aspect ratio just google it, do not  think that you are  dumb everyone is weak at something it is better to gain knowledge about them asap now we will  move forward to the next one which i have  written here if a page is inside a directory we need to make sure that the link we are using is for the correct page\" what do i mean by this?and it is  href attribute & absolute and relative links now we will  talk about the \"image tags\" image tag is very simple & straight forward they are used to add images in your html page it means if you want to add images in your html page so you can use the img tag theres also it is  attribute which is src which tell you which image you want to add  or the complete address of the image for eg.i have  already told you in my notes with the help of  tag  tag is used to create line breaks in html which means if you want \"this is bold\" \"this is italic\" & \"this is underline\" in different lines so you must use  tag  is an empty tagin cake if you want to add chocolate or cake just like these ingredients you have to add html tags in html web page now just like you make food theres a recipe you add the ingredients accordingly it is  not like you added 10 tsp chilli powder and 20 tsp salt theres a sequence in the recipe which we have to follow just like theres a sequence of using html tags you have to add those tags accordingly now look, html stands for hypertext markup language html is the language of the web it is used to create websites we use html tags to define look & feel of the website with understanding of these tags and how to put them together, we can create beautiful websites easily we can create a very beautiful website with understanding these tags if we know how we can use these tags together so we can make very beautiful websites just like i made \"codewithhary.com\" i definitely used my html knowledge while creating it html knowledge will definitely be used while creating any type of website the biggest question people will have in their mind is \"if html is enough so why we need css & js? \"let suppose if you forget to check those options so you run it again just like me you  will not  face any loss you  will not  lose any important file i  will not  launch itbecause title is the main thing which is shown in the search if you come across a good title so theres high chances that you will  click on that because the very step is to click on to the website and if you will  only read the content when you will  find it useful if you do not  click on the website and your website does not  have ctr (click through rate)now as i opened this tag now i have  to close this tag too we have  to open almost all html tags and we also have to close them there are a few tags which does not  need to be closed, and those tags are called empty tags but most of the tags which we use in the page & which contains the content we have to close those type of tags i have  added opened \"head\" tag & then \"title\" tagso whenever you are  creating a serious website this website not a serious one i am  just creating it to teach you if you are  creating a web-page for college fest or to collect information about your classmates or a group of your company if you are  doing stuff like this then it is not a serious website but if you are  starting a blog and you want to generate your living from that then thats a serious businessso look i have not  added anything in the header for now i will  write \"this is header\" and in footer i will  write \"this is footer\" i will  save it & open it with live server and my website will open in live server and as you can see \"this header\" \"this is the main content\" &  they must have added this in their meta tag now look, if i open this website then theres high chance that they must have added met description and you can see that they have added meta tag for description we have  got a lot of types of meta tags but you must set the meta tag for description theres no guarantee about your content displaying here as is it google will use your meta description only when it will  find it usable i am  telling you this with my experience, i have  noticed this from all the websites which i build & appeared on google now \"set a nice url slug\" what does this mean?the equation is now displayed correctly (  c  +  o₂  ➜  co₂  )\"background:red\" and then i will  close it in this way and when i will  minify it so look it has removed all the spaces & new lines if a bigger css files contains a lot of spaces so size of that file will increase and this website remove all of them and when we write html or css code in this format we add more spaces & new lines because we have to increase the readability we do the format document to increase the readability so that when we or our fellow programmer read this code or tries to improve this code so he  will not  find this code difficult to read & rubbish so we want to avoid these type of things but when computer read this file so you can give a compressed file which means you can remove these new lines & extra spacesif theres an anchor tag and you are  specifying the href attribute and writing it is  value in it so first the name of the attribute and then after \" = \" the value of attribute in double quotes (\" \") or single quotes(\\' \\') and then you can write the tag as usual now i have  written here we either use single quotes (\\' \\') or double quotes (\" \") in attribute and now comes the heading tag lets discuss the heading tag whenever you build your website or any page of your website then you would like to give it a heading heading tag is used to mark headings in html if you want to make any text a headingnow open this and i will  provide you a new text document after writing \"new text document\" i will  write... ...\"notepad.html\" i will  do one thing, for now i will  just change it to \"notepad.txt\" and i will  add some html code in iti have  told you it is used to add paragraph and how you can add paragraph and if you want to change the paragraph so you can change it like this when i will  write \"lorem34\" so 34 words will appear by the way look a horizontal scroll bar has appeared here and if you want a view like this instead of this horizontal scroll bar let me show you what i am  talking about now if we click on \"toggle word wrap\" so this scroll bar will disappear and line no. will appear which means in actual this is not the line #17 but only this content is line #17 but this is displaying you in multiple lines so you do not  have to scroll it horizontally this is called word wrap and we can see the word wrap functionality in a lot of idesthis is the paragraph but i will  go to my  would iv\\' tag the  would iv\\' tag was inside the main tag i have  added that in section look how much this  would iv\\' should occupy space?this is the equation of carbon oxidization so we will  write this let me tell you how you can write this in a paragraph you can write it  ( c  +  o2 ➜  co2 ) if you write it like thisbut it is occupying the whole space so  would iv\\' element or  would iv\\' like other element wherever they step-in the whole space belongs to them and span\\' is a like an innocent boy it only focus on it is  job and span\\' only occupy the space it needs i will  remove the paragraph from here because it is a block element and i will  only keep the span\\' paragraph is a block element & span\\' is an in-line elementif i do not  type \"index.html\" in my url bar even then i will  get the same page \"this is a heading, this is a paragraph\" if my page was not  named \"index.html\" suppose if i rename this file lets suppose if i rename it by pressing \"f2\" and if i give it any random name if i give it \"this.html\" instead of \"index.html\" you can name it after someones name i will  name it \"harry.html\" will i be able to see anything after changing it is  name?\"codewithhary\" so if you visit \"/blogs\" so you will  be here and if you visit \"/videos\" so you will  be here if you click on \"/contact me\" so you will  be here and  if you click on \"/start watching\" so you will  be here when you visit \"/videos/java tutorial for beginners\" so you end up on this page so they have added a mixture of absolute & relative links in the source of wikipedia and your version of wikipedia is unable to find the relative links... ...which are related to \"wikipedia.org\" but it is trying to find that pages on \"127.0.0:5500\" let me show you thisand i hope you have  installed the vscode we can use any text editor of our choice once again let me tell you here i am  using vscode because it is lightweight open-source from microsoft you just simply have to visit the google and search \"vscode\" just install it like me you can write html even in notepad text-editors like vscode just make these things easier we will  see how vscode make these things easier i will  make this \"cwh.html\" file, a blank file let me show you how vscode facilitate in a great we-development if you add an \"exclamation mark\" (!)i will  open the pdf which i created for you and as you can see i have  written about some basic tags here we can add elements inside the body tag to define the page layout we have  learned that we have a body tags which is rendered by the body and we can add some tags in that body tag which will be visible to us in the browser we have  learned about h1 tag\"this is a heading\" and after this i will  write a paragraph \"this is a paragraph\" and lets leave for now for this heading & paragraph is because we just want to generate an html page and we want to open that in  a \"live server\" because we want to see how our page will look in our server look, as i opened this in a \"live server\" so what is written in the url \"127.0.0.1:5500\" which is a server created by \"live server\" extension after creating this server it is displaying \"index.html\" page through this server but.... listen to me carefully if i do not  write this \"index.html\" then what will happen?h1 for the bigger heading & h6 for the smaller we do not  have to do this and we have to use the heading carefully we have to write the paragraph with the paragraph tag and we have to write the headings with the heading tag we have to use them carefully now look, i have  told you about paragraphs, anchors and all that now lets move back to the notes i have  written something here which i have  just told you note:-let me show you a  would iv\\' and then i will  show you a span\\'  would iv\\' is a container and span\\' is also a container i will  write \"i am  a span tag here\" herehow we do content optimization writing content according to \"which content is being search for how many time\" this also comes under seo but... we  will not  focus on that aspect we will  look for the existing which already have written how to add seo in that page how can we improve the ranking of that website by adding more html tags & optimization and not by any illegal means we will  actually provide value to our users and how will we do that?lets suppose if you install the third party javascript library or if you use third-party css frame work it is possible that they have targeted some particular tags like header or footer and you are  not using that layout so maybe you will  face problems while using that library thats why i am  suggesting better user experience so now we will  learn how to create a layout of a website ideally your website will contain a header and then a main tag and a footerwe will  create that through css & js bur now we are  only learning html so thats why we will  first finish this html step and then we will  move to the responsiveness you can use \"inspect elements\" & \"view page source\" and html elements = start tag + content + end tagyou do not  have to learn these things i am  just showing you after removing the css style sheets and look after removing  css style sheets this is how it looks now you do not  have to learn how to remove style sheets because i am  going to teach you thisyou have  to maintain the consistency if you are  using the single quotes(\\' \\') then keep using them and if you are  using the double quotes (\" \") then keep using them so i will  remove these double quotes (\" \") from here because here the url of the website is this one & it does not  contain the double quotes (\" \")i am  going to add a sub heading in it and...... the main reason lets suppose we are writing the main reasons and the paragraph and lets suppose we have  written 45 words in the main reasons so when i will  open my page in live server so this is what it will  look like so theres a page headingyes it is fine i have  changed it knowingly now i will  open it with notepad i will  open it simple notepad which every computer have if you are  using a mac or linux so a basic editor is definitely shipped with each operating system so lets move here & what we will  do?so i hope you have  understood how to write the absolute & relative urls now we will  move back to the notes and we will  talk about the \"bold, italic & underline tags\" we can use \"bold, italic & underline tags\" to highlight our texts so let me give you a demo of \"bold, italic & underline tags\" so i will  write \"bold, italic & underline tags\"so look i have  been redirected to \"codewithharry.com\" so it does not  matter if theres an image or a text you will  be redirected to the website in a new tab i hope that this was easy now if i also add height here let me take you to the note i have  written something \"if the page is inside the directory we need to make sure that we link to the correct page\"lets suppose you want to show \"human image\" i know this is very weird but \"alt\" means the text that should be shown when the image is unable to load if i change this to \"unsplash4.com\" so this image might not load and i will  be able to see \"human image\" which means the \"alt\" and now if i fix the url which i messed up so as i will  save it then i  will not  be able to see the \"alt\" which means the text in the \"alt\" will only be shown when the image is unable to be load\"playing audio\" \"main tag\" \"semantic tag\" \"seo\" there are a lot of thing which people usually miss i am  going to cover all these topics in this video and i will  make you a successful + profitable html developer so that you can get a good starter and you can build good websites now i want to tell you difference between html, css & js with an analogy html is like a human skeleton and css is just like the skin on the skeleton this means it beautifies that css do the same work on html just like skin do on our skeleton our skin provides help to our skeleton to look good and css helps the html to look beautiful just like our brain impart the logic in us just like that js provides logic to website made with htmli mean logic when to put break & at how much pressure how to change the gears what will happen after changing the gear take this as an example of javascript what will happen when the user will change the gear now suppose there is a car which looks good but its break does not  function & it is  engine is also broken so that car is also useless so this is role of html, css & js on a website the html is the frame of a website css is the decoration and javascript is the frontend logic why am i referring it as frontend logic so javascript is a type of client side logic which means the logic that user can also see and backend logic is always hidden from us the server from where this website is coming for example my website was designed in django so what logic is djangos backend is using i will never know i can only see the logic of frontend i can see it is  logic that how is it functioning= \"cwh.jfif \" and in alt i will  write \"harrys website\" so i will  cut this and i will  save it and let me add width attribute \"width = 123\" and image have width & height both attributes we will  talk about this soon but the point i want highlight here let me show that firstyou are  commanding \"https://\" which means theres a website on internet \"codewithharry\" redirect on that so these two are different the difference is in this you can visit globally from any computer but in this you can only visit when you are  in a same server which means you have to only use the relative link when you are  in your server actually i am  using live server+ /\" to do comment & uncomment comment means to comment any text uncomment means to uncomment any text which is already commented commenting-uncommenting.... and we will  use this terminology a lot while programming i will  leave \"improve below paragraph\" & \"this heading will be changed in future\" i will  leave all these as they are and read the next point \"case sensitivity\" is html a case sensitive language?  and this is how you can write  tag and wherever you will  add  tag a new line will be added i will  expect a new line after \"this is bold\" and \"this is italic\"anchor tag is used to add links to an existing content inside an html page which means if you want to add links in an html page it means if you want to redirect the user to a different page within the site or you want to redirect the user globally to a different website so you can the anchor tag just like i have  added an absolute url here of \"codewithharry.com\" so if someone clicks on this so they will  be redirected to the harrys website if i write \"href = /about.html\"yes definitely i was able and when you will  learn the css then you will  know how many options you have to solve this question and when you will  learn the css you will  find that you can change the size of any element and when you can do that so sometimes you become too greedy to use the easy tags just like changing the font & paragraphi have  closed it mistakenly thats good that i managed to saved it i have  saved it & look how this page is rendering h1 will look like this and may be this too is h1, i have  written h1 twice if i am  not wrongi hope you have  understood the html and in future i will  upload a course for css with notes and please do tell in the comments if you want that too and in that we will  learn how to make websites we will  learn to create good websites templates and cssh1 has the opening & closing tags with content in between just like that \"paragraph\" has the opening & closing tags with content in between we have  understood this most of the html elements have opening & closing tags with content in between we have  discussed this \"some html tags have no content\" there are some html tags which does not  contain any content for eg.as i have  used this \"cwh.jfif\" lets suppose this is inside a folder with name \"img\" suppose i have  moved all my images to the img folder let us say i am  using 100 images in this particular website and i do not  want a bundles of images here in my directory'"

       "'we will not talk about them much. meta description sets the meta description. meta description means that you have to add a meta tag. let me tell you how to add meta tag. and lets open this folder in vscode and obviously i will close the other folder and i will make a file with the name \"seohtml\" and obviously i will add a boiler plate code in it and here i will write \"s-e-o\" and then lets say, i will add a header here and then i will add a nav tag and then i will add \"ul\" and then \"li\" and then i will write \"home\" in it. and similarly i will add \"about\" after \"home\". and lets say: this is how i am creating my website: \"about\" and after \"about\" i will write \"contact\". so a basic website always contains \"home\", \"about\", \"contact\". now lets say i am adding a section\\' in its main content & after that lets say i am adding a would iv\\' in itso. span\\' will only occupy the space it needs. you can see as i keep arrow on it. so it is highlighting. span\\' is only occupying this much space and theres another span\\' by it, because span\\' is like an innocent boy, which means it is an in-line element. \"in-line\" contains 2 words: \"in\" & \"line\", which means ins, a single line. so it is an in-line element. and i will mention here: \" span\\' is an example of an in-line element \" and obviously i will comment this out. and then i will write: \" would iv\\' is an example of a block element \". i will comment this out too, and, look, i am using \" ctrl + / ) for commenting out. it is a very simple shortcut. so we have now learned in-line & block element. so in chapter-3 we learned that there are 2 types of container: would iv\\' & span\\'. would iv\\' is an in-line element & span\\' is a block element. i have written this for you. would iv\\' tag is often used as a container for other elements. would iv\\' is a block level element. span\\' is an in-line container, which means it only occupies space it needs. so we have learned that span\\' tag is an in-line container and would iv is a block level element. block element means it occupies space more than it needs and in-line element means it only occupies space which is necessary. you have to remember one thing: if you add a block level container in an in-line container, so the block level container will occupy the whole space. so thats why i did not add paragraph in span\\' and i added only text, or you can also add any other in-line tagyou must ask these type of questions from yourselves. when you do that, \"create a page with 5 wallpaper images taken from the internet\", you have to take 5 wallpapers from the internet and you have to display them. and if i search for wallpaper, then to the images. and if you only want to display them so you can find a lot of wallpaper images, look, we have got a lot of wallpaper images, so you can use any wallpaper from this. it does not matter which wallpaper you will use. if i use this wallpaper, i will do right click > open image in new tab and i will copy the url of this image and take this. so you just have to choose any wallpaper from these wallpaper & you have to display it. and you have to solve this question on your own. i am not going to solve this. the reason is you should have knowledge about how to do this, because i already have shown many examples. and the third question is to \"use br & hr tags to display a piece of text with line bricks\". try this question, too, on your own, because i want to keep this video short & to the point. thats why i have given questions for the practice, so that you can do practice on your own. the forth question is: \"try the following equation using html\". you have to write this equation from html: ( c + o₂ ➜ co₂ )we will click right --> view page source and we will copy this and paste it here. i have simply pasted it. i am telling you, the website will not look 100% good because there are styles which i am using through sever roots. for now we will not discuss this. we will just keep in mind that it is not this easy to view page source of any website. copied it is code and paste it in a notepad and we can copy that website. it is not possible, but maybe it is possible. lets have a look. so i have saved it. i have opened it with notepad by clicking rightlets guess what tag will it be? this is definitely a heading tag. you can inspect it and it will be the h1 tag. this is the primary heading of this page, so this will be h1 tag. lets suppose, if you will not find this h1 in any page, so the developer of that page has made a mistake, because if you have not use the heading tag, even in your heading, so theres something wrong with your page. your page can be displayed using the css without using the heading tags, but it will not be called best practice. you have to do this with a good practice. if you use best software techniques for building website or apps, then you will get advantages. i just want to tell you this now. i will close this, because our chapter-2 practice set has been completed. i have also hand picked some question so that you can do your practice after completing the chapter-2. i just want to keep these notes, as if you have these notes & this video, then whenever you will turn the page, you will remember everything. and i also have given practice so that if you ever have to do revision, then you just have to turn some pages. now we will move to the chapter-3, and in chapter-3 we will learn how we can structure a website, because if you learn how to structure a website, then you can easily create any type of websiteso. this is how yo have to add its url \"img/cwhjfif\", which means in the img folder. btw, you can name this folder of your choice. it is not mandatory to name it \"img\". you can also name it \"harry\". io just named it \"img\", because i can easily recognize that it contains images, and this error will be fixed, so theres nothing to be worried about. i just wanted to tell you because this is mostly used when you will use frame work. if you use flask, django, angular or view, you will have to face these things. at the end of the day, all these frame work renders html. so we have learned this and this, and we have learned that we can use img tag in anchor tag and we have leaned that we can set only one attribute from the height & the width and the second one will be set automatically. and we also have learned that we can use any one] from the single(\\'_\\') or double quote(\"_\"), because it increase the consistency and you do not want the other developers to remember you in bad terms, you want them to remember you in good terms and you want to write a good code with the easiest way, and if you are maintaining the code on your own, then it increase a reason to maintain it correctly. now we will talk about would iv\\' and would iv\\' tag used as a container for other elements. what does it meanso? i can zoom it like this. so to learn all these things, we use vscode, or i will say, to enjoy these features. we use vscode, because we got a lot of things in vscode and theres nothing in notepad. to change the font size, you have to press a lot keys, so thats why we will not use notepad. but we can definitely use notepad. we just have to understand how to do things. now we will move to the chapter-1, where we will create our first website. we will learn different kind of things and learn about \"indexhtml\" and we will learn about we page structure. what is a basic web page structure? lets move to chapter-1 now. so, guys, we will now move to chapter-1. firstly, we will open this, and the chapter-1 is \"creating pour first website\", which will tell us how we can create our website. so before starting this, let me tell you that every website is made up of html and we start building a website by creating a file named \"indexhtml\". so i will open my vscode, and my vscode is opened in this folder, in which folder\"just press the \\'enter\\' and i will see the rest\". emmet is so good. there are very few people like emmet in this world. just write \"h1\" and then \"list of books\". you have written \"list of books\" or i will write \"books to read\" \"books to read\", i will write whatever the heading i want to add, and then i will write \"p\" and then i will write \"there are a lot of books to read for you\", and now i will save it and then i will open it with live server & you know what will happen- and it will open in liver server and then i will be able, too, see this heading & paragraph. so, look, i have written an opening tag & a closing tag & then a content in between- what is meant by contentand i will open this chapter 0 pdf here and, as you can see, i have written \"chapter 0- introduction\". html = hypertext markup language, and html is the language of the web. it is used to create websites. if you ever visited a website- lets suppose \"wwwcodewithharrycom\", if you ever visit a website and then you go to \"view page source\", so you will be able to see the actual source of this website, you will be able to see how this website was made, what are thing which was used in frontend, which type of tags they have used, and now, if you do not know about html, then maybe you will find these tags over-whelming. but let me tell you i am going to make these things very easy for you all. so we have lean about full from of html. it is hypertext markup language. this is the language of the web, which means you will need this if you want to display beautiful web pages. it is used to create websites. we use html tags to define look & feel of a website. to define the look & feel of a website, we use the html, for. egi will open this same folder in the vscode, because this is the chapter-2s practice set. i will create a file here with a name \"chater_2_practice_set\" or \"practice_sethtml\". i will add boiler plate code and i will name it \"chapter 2- practice set\" and in the body i am going to add the code from which we are going to solve this question. so if i want to add a primary heading, so it definitely will be h1, and lets suppose i am writing about the mountains, and after that, let us say i am adding the secondary heading and i am writing \"why mountains\" and let us say i have written a paragraph which contains 45 words and i will turn on the word wrapso the search engines started discouraging this and they have decided not to use \"meta name = keyword\" at all. so this came to light and theres no mdn link for \"meta name = keywords\". if you hover on it, then you will find no mdn link. you will find for meta element but not for \"meta name = keywords\" and this is reason that even mdn community has denied this. so i wanted to tell you this about keyword description: so do not set the meta keyword tags, because people have abused that. and even if you add sweet keyboard stag, if you add a small tag with 2-3 keyword, then it is not a problem in my opinion. so the next point is to set the meta author tag. and we have to set the meta author tag because if you are writing a blog, then you must want to mention about the author and your users will also want to know about the author because maybe they are interested in reading the content of their favourite author. and then we will move to \"set a fav icon\" and let me tell you what is fav icon. i will visit the \"fav icon generator\" and look, they are telling how you can make your fav icon. suppose that i am visiting this website & i have downloaded a fav icon. so after downloading, i will unzip it & i will do \"extract to fav icon\" and you can see it has given me some icons and i can use them as a fav iconand i am adding a paragraph in a container in which i have added \"lorem34\", which i have added some sample text, and let me show you this website in live server and this is our website, and i will close all these links and look, this is how my website is looking. now. let us say that i want to add meta tag in this website. look, i already have added the title. now, if i only add seo in it, let us say i am talking about seo. this is not at all an appropriate title, because if you are talking about the seo, then write this in this way: \"seo- a beginners guide\". seo in 2021: a beginners guide. \"seo in 2022: a beginners guide\". so if someone search for \"how will seo change in 2021\" and your article is providing information for that content, so theres high chance that the user will click on that. so your page must contain very click-able title & the content related to your title. this page does not contain anything about seothis is big or this is small. i will add the \"small\" in: \"this is small\". this is small and, as you can see, i have got big & small of different size. and now, after this, we will talk about how you can add a horizontal divider in html theres and tag for it. as i am explaining you these topics, just as i explained the topic of heading & paragraph, i will write \"heading & paragraph\" and i will comment it out. and after heading 7, paragraph, i explained you about links. i want that i will separate them with a horizontal line. and then i explained you about the image tagyou do not have to be worried about. i am just adding the css just to show you how you can change the bg of a particular would iv\\' i have change a particular would iv\\' bg to \\'purple\\' and another would iv\\' to are d\\' so this is how i can add styles. and to add styles, i have divided them. these 2 are together and these 2 are together. now we will talk about the in-line & block elements. what is in-line elementwe add a forward slash(/) and we write the name of that tag, which means and it becomes a closing tag. we will open & close all the tags in the way in html. we will create html elements. here i will click right > open with code, and this folder has been opened in vscode. so now look, i have opened this folder in vscode. now we will create a website here and the name for html page will be \"indexhtml\" for obvious reasons. now i will add an exclamation mark()whenever the search engines like google will read your page, so they will think that you are writing the most important heading in the h1 and after that, as you are using the h2,, h3, h4. you are decreasing the importance, which means if you have used the h1 for \"books to read\", so the search engine will think- or any bot whos crawling your website will think- that the h1 is the primary topic of your page. so you have to use the h1.h6 tags very wisely if you want the search engine optimization and if you want to convey your pages content easily with any bot crawler or a search engine. so use the tag wisely. you never have to use the h1-h6 tags to define the sizes of the headings. i have seen some people who learned the html recently use the h1-h6 tags in a way to define the sizes of the heading for eglet us say i have to pack a paragraph and a heading in a particular section. lets suppose i am creating another section and i have to add different heading & paragraph. lets suppose i have to choose h1 and i will write \"why love html\" and then i will write a paragraph here. i will write: \"html is a quite good language and it has turned my life upside-down\". i will write something like this, and any html developer who loves html will write thisi am just taking an example, & it is not like that. you can write anything and your page will pop on the top. i have written this & now we will add meta tag here. now, look, theres already a meta tag for \"view port\". i will write \"meta\" & then \"desc\" and then i will write about seo. seo is like. suppose i will write anything. this is a nice article on seoif you do not know css, then give it a shot later. i have made videos on css. for now, just focus on html, and i want this div to be of red color. i am showing you, but do not think that you ca not do that. i will save this page and the changes will reflect automatically, and let me reset it with (ctrl + scroll). now lets suppose i want to change the bg of this. would iv\\' to are d\\' how am i doing thisno, you can change the bg color through css, but with javascript you can even control that with javascript. you can choose to hide or show anything & for as many minutes as you like. with the help of javascript, we will learn all these things and you know these things will be in their place when i will reload the page. now lets have a look on a beautiful analogy which i have written. this is a very good analogy. thats why i refer it as \"beautiful\". if html is your cars body, let us assume you are a car manufacturer. if you are not, then just assume. and now i will search for a video on youtube which is related to car manufacturing, and i have got a video related to car manufacturing. now look at these cars, look at their unpainted body. just take those bodies as html. and now, if i paint this and make some designs, add some designed lights in it- tail lights, head lamps- and add a good wind shield and make it like that. everyone who see this will be amazed by its design. for now, no one will be amazed by this cars design. there are cars like sport cars. you will be amazed by their design. so if you see those type of cars, the first one is its frame. along with that, they have designed it. so just like that, with html, you design the frame of your website and then you design it with the cssi. have explained briefly about the seo and if you are a web developer, then you must want to learn seo at any point of time. let me tell you what i have learned about seo in my life. i will tell you in very short term, but it will be very effective. in my opinion, using seo with-in a limit is good, but seo is not about using. is a website like? let me show you which type of website i am talking about. it is not like if i open this website in a live server, if you search for videos on google, if i search videos on googleso whenever you want to gain more information about any tag, so you can visit its mdn reference and there you can ready everything about that tag. if you are an advance user, so you will understand this, but if you are a beginner, so do not be scared. they have given a little demo here, so just look at it, or i have covered everything in notes & this video. so theres is, was or will be, nothing to be worries about, and we are here to shoot all the tensions & troubles. now look, i have told you about link attribute- how to open in a new tab, and i also have told you that we can put any content inside an anchor tag, like images & headings. for now i have just added a text, but if there was an image, so you can also go to the \"codewithharrycom\" by clicking on that imagebut i want you do this on your own because if you inspect a website, so first take away you will get is that you will learn to change your favourite websites, and that can be any website. i will change the \"codewithharry\" website. so now we are on \"codewithharycom\" and i will show you changing this. by the way, i already did that one time before. lets suppose i want to change \"contact me\" and i want to change it to \"contact this person\". so this is how i can change this and make sure to try this on your own. try to change it. it is not important to change this website and i know that 90% of you will change \"codewithhary\". try another website. you can change anything, or you can also use \"codewithhary. try to change your favourite website. it is very fun when the web page is changed. very few people are familiar with that and those who know is good for theirselves. go to your favourite website & try to view the page source and write the exact lines of code. does it clone the websiteit is called boiler plate code. boiler plate code of html will appear here and i will create it with a name: \"chapter-3\". now what i will do is, as i have told you about a header tag, i have used a header tag here, and then i will use a main tag here, and then i will add a paragraph here and i will write \"this is the main content\" and after pressing ( ctrl + enter )and i have also opened the chapter-2s pdf, it does not matter. we have learned a lot of things. we learned about big, small, pre subscript & superscript tags, and i think it was fun because we have learned how to build a website. now what we will do is we will do some questions so that you can hold tight on to the html and you can understand better about whatever the tags, properties & attribute we have learned. so the first question is: \"create an html page with a heading\", which is going to be the title of the pagebecause you want that traffic must hit your website if you are a blogger or you provide any type of service. so you want the traffic on your website and you want the people to come on your website & appreciate your hard work. so we have learned about the se index and now we will move back to the chapter-3 notes and we will learn how to use these 3 tags. so we add navigation bar in the header and we add nav tag in it and in in main tags we add \"section\", article\" & \"aside\" tag, and these three tags are most commonly used tags. you can add \"div\" here. we will learn more about \"div\" later, but these 3 are the most important tags which you must have knowledge about. these are the opening & closing tags of main tag. basically, we have talked about header, footer & main tag\"this is bold\", \"this is italic\" & \"this is underline\" appeared in a single line, which means if i add a new line here, even then this new line will not be displayed. as you can see, new line has not been displayed and i have even saved the page. so even if i add multiple new lines, that will not effect it\". or if i add some extra spaces- look how many extra i have added here. here i have written \"this is italic\" and what does rendered herei do not know why you can write javascript. here i will tell you how these things actually works. so i will open my javascript console where i can write my javascript, and here i will quickly write \"documentbodystylebackgroundcolor = \"red\". i repeat, i have written this line which says: turn the bodys background are d\\'. and look, as i press the \"enter\", as i inject the javascript, this turns are d\\'. and how to perform these thingsi will move downward and after \"main\" i will create a footer with and as you will create these tags, vscode will completely support you. by \"support\" i means that whenever you will write something, it will auto-complete it. if you put you arrow won any particular tag, so it will provide you a link for mdn reference. so it will become very easy for you to understand things and to do to the reference of a particular tagso. i hope this practice set was very beneficial for you and you have understood this easily. now we will move to chapter-2, where we will learn about some basic tags. i will see you in chapter-2. so, guys, we are now on chapter-2, in which we will learn about some basic tags, and we will use those tags to create some websites. so i will quickly open the chapter-2yes, the optimization has taken place. but if a blog is related to a particular person, you may have seen some websites in which people make a very basic page in html. after all that, those website pop-up on the top, reason being \"relevance\" because those website contains the content which user actually searched for. i will not explain more about seo. i only have included seo in chapter-5. that is necessary for you to learn if you are learning the html. we will focus only on html stand point of seo. we will not dive to depth of the seo because it includes a lot of things. we will not be looking in to keyword building in content optimization aspect of seo, how we do keyword buildingso. you will find a boost in seo and your load time will also decrease, because you were loading the file of 100 mb at that time and now you are loading the file of just 2 mb. so definitely your load time will decrease. so compressing the image decrease your load time and the benefit of minifying & compressing the html, css & js files is that you are not downloading the extra files. and after this, \"add alt text to images\". i have told yo about an alt attribute in which, if an image is failed to load, so a text will be displayed, and it is a good practice because if your image failed to load, then you will will see an alt text, and if it also help the blind peoples who come to read the content on your website, so the devices read the alt text to explain them the topic of your imagelook here. this have been rendered and as soon as i save this page, it is displaying the changes automatically after reloading. by the way, this is not a work of html. this is the work if live server. live server is an extension which reflects the changes when you save your files. every time i build my website template, i always use the live server. this extension was made greatly in vscode. now we have understood. \"a tag is like a container\". your html document is nothing more than this. it is just a piece of code. whatever website you see on your daily basis- just like if you are seeing my website- the actual website is not this one, but this one. this is the source code. it is about the code and not about the images or red colored button or anything it contains. your website transports in the form of this code. in actual, this code gets transported and then, as soon as your browser gets this code, it renders this code in this form. so the code is provided to the browser through server and browser renders the code in this form, which you usually see. so now lets understand: as soon as your browser gets this html document. so your browser plays a major role in converting this code to a viewable formor, i will say, a good enough website. so we are going to learn more about this. we can add elements inside the body tag to define the page layout. i will talk about html element. what do i mean by html element? html elements means an opening tag & a closing tag. whenever we write an html tag, we write 2 tags: \"opening tag & closing tag\" and the content in between. this content can be a text or more opening & closing tags. so thats why i have written this as content. i can also write this as then any headingso. you want the search engines to understand your website, so i have written \"creating a page like this is not necessary\", but it creates a readable & structured layout, just like i have shown you. and these type of pages are also seo friendly, because when the computer is able to understand your page, look the google also want to index your page if you mention, lets suppose you are trowing a party for the whole india and you said that whoever comes, i will provide the best party ever. but how will the people know that you are providing such part? you must have to convey the information by any means, just like that. your page must contains some very obvious tags, because when the things are obvious, so you keep them in mind, this person is throwing a party. its very obvious. or if you structure your page like thisbut i will only talk about on-page, which can be done by html developers, and in on-page seo you can do seo through html. html developer can implement seo using following techniques. we will talk about some techniques. and again, this not a comprehensive right to seo, which means it is not like if you learn this, then you have completed seo. i will make a course for seo in futurebut we were unable to copy it 100%. look here, this is different & this is different. we will also understand its reason and we will understand its reason briefly in the upcoming chapters, but for now, just remember you do not have to download anything. look, the images are missing from here. style sheets took some time to be downloaded. it is working, but some images are missing. but again, if you click on a blog, so it is not working. so the conclusion is you can copy the website, but not 100%. it is not that easy to copy the website now. if you have understanding, so you can do, it is not that difficult. but it is not that easy becauseand i will click on \"finish\". and if you follow every step and if you have installed the vscode as i told you, and if you right click here so you will find an option here: \"open with code\". we command it to show this option when we were installing the vscode. click on \"open with code\" and after that you will see all the files of this directory here- not here, but here- and you can create a new file by click here and create a new folder by clicking here. if you are using vscode for the first time, then do not be scared, because you will get used to once you use itin, the closing tags. so it will think that you have only written this much after the \\'href\\', so it will be confused and can also give a syntax error. so if you are using the double quotes (\" \") in your attributes content, so remember to use single quotes(\\' \\') in the outer and vice versa. if you are using the single quotes(\\' \\') in attribute, so use the double quotes (\" \"), or else you can use anyone from the single quotes(\\' \\') & double quotes (\" \"). but in the end i will advice you to maintain the consistencyand if i press the \"tab\" key & write here \"go to about\", so it will try to visit the \"abouthtml\". i will create an \"abouthtml\" here, i will change the title with \"about\" and i will write \"lorem45\" by writing a paragraph, and then i will write \"this is about\". a very simple thing from \"indexhtml\" as i click on \"go to about\". so look, i have been redirected to \"abouthtml\". this is the relative linkit is asking you you have to add \"href = https//codewithharrycom\" and then write the content: \"click here to go to harrys website\". suppose you have written something like this. now, when you look at it, you will found a link on \"click here to go to harrys website\" and when you click on it, you will be redirected to \"codewithharrycom\". so what is the \\'href\\' written with the anchor tag in actual, \\'href\\' is a link to a website and it will open whenever you will click on this textso what do you think if you have created a website like youtube & done the seo without providing any value. do you think that your website will pop-up on the top while searching for the youtube? definitely not, so search engine optimization is a way to improve the existing ranking a lil-bit. pay close attention. i will rather say seo is the way to help search engine finding your website. so at maximum you can just specify the google about your website & it is content. if you have made an excellent website on internet and then you think that your website will pop-up on the top and you have also written a good content, so the search engines like google, bing & yahoo also ask about your website, its content & description. like \"codewithharrycom\" is a website. this website is about whoso i hope you got the point, and there were an error in my pages that the fav icon was not appearing, but that error has been fixed now. so if you set the fav icon in this way, then it will provide a good user experience and user will find that he is on a genuine website, which is good. now the next point is \"compress images & other resources\". if you write image compressor, so you will find some image compressing website on internet in which you can upload your image and compress them, which means you can lower their size without having to lose a lot of quality. your image quality does get low when you compress them, but there are some compressions which can give you great compression. by decreasing minimum quality, it is possible that your 25 mb image may turn to 2 mb, and you do not have to pay a lot of loss in quality. now lets suppose if you are displaying your 100 mb image in just this small portion. so theres no point in thator \\'html\\' extension\" along with \"html\". we can also use \"htm\" extension if we do not add \"l\" in \"html\", if we are lazy and we do not want to type the whole \"html\", but we only want to type \"htm\". so you are welcome. you can do that too. your templates will work. but i want to give you a disclaimer. sometimeslet me show you the live server is unable to detect the \"indexhtm\". it detects \"indexhtml\" as a starting page. but if you open the \"indexhtm\", so you will get this page totally rendered, which means we mostly have to use \"html\" extension and we do not have to use \"htm\"\"thistxt\" and you can write anything here. this is some content on this file. save it and after this you have to click here in you extension tab and after that you have to install an extension which is \"live server\". now, many of you are using this very first time and you do not have any idea about \"live server\". just install this \"live server\" \"installing\" and it is now installed. now, as you can see, \"live server\" has been installed and i can open any file with \"live server\". let me show you the file we created, \"cwhhtml\". if i right click on this file and click on \"open with live server\", look, i will click on this & it is asking me something and i will cancel it. and after this, look it will create a live server for me. it creates a server like a website and then display all the files. you can open it directly with double click on these files, but this method is recommended because this creates a web server for you and if you are using web server. so the advantage of using a web server iscss. i have discuss briefly more about this in chapter 0, where i have explained this with another analogy. but now we will understand the difference between the backend & frontend. and how does a basic website works whenever a web browser request \"wwwcodewithharycom\" from a web server, so in return, web server send the files of html, css and js, your browser parce these html, css and js files, and show you what you actually see in a website- actually, it was codes, but your browser parce that- in such a manner that a beautiful website is visible to you. i have divided this video in 5 chapters where i have provided a practice set with each chapter so that you can practice. itthose are its children. now i will show you one thing very interesting from the vscode. now, if you click on the left side of \"the head\", so look, they have collapsed and now they have expanded- collapse-expend, collapse-expend. so now look, the html contains the head & the body. understand this in a way that html have 2 children, \"head\" & \"body\". so when html have 2 children, \"head\" & \"body, so html is obviously the father of \"head\" & \"body\". this is simple, man. please do not say that you did not understood this. this is very simple thing. so html is the parent of \"head\" & \"body\". and what is the relation between \"head\" & \"body\"? they are \"siblings\". this is the exact word we use. \"head\" & \"body\" are siblings. now look here i have written this: \"head & body are the children, tags of html tags\". in the same way. \"h1\" & \"paragraph\" are the children ofso i hope you got the point: \"how to display an html document\". now lets talk about the important notes. i have written some things here which are important: \"head and body tags are children of html tags\". so, look, you can see your whole code in a way like this: first you have specified your doc-type, that your doc-type will be html. you will find the first tag very unique in compare to the other tags, and then our main html page starts. we have written html here and where is its closing? tag\"xu-a compatible\" is used for the microsofts old browsers, compatibility, and \"view port\" is used to change the initial scale. there are more tags similar to these 2 tags which we can use to build our website. but first of all we will learn about some most important tags in html, body contains all the tags which you will see on this web page. the tags which are displayed are present in the body. now look here. i have mentioned this in notes: \"the main body of the page rendered by the browser\". this is the tag visible here, and then i have added a paragraph tag and a heading. tagresponsive means if you use this website in any device, so it looks good. it is not like if you a build website for just phones and if you are opening that in a computer so it is creating problem. responsive means that your website is adaptive to all devices. so nowadays responsiveness is must for websites. if any client ask you to build website, so he will not specify you. 10 years ago responsiveness was an extra feature. it was count as an extra feature provided by a good programmer. but nowadays it is a necessity, not an option. 10 years ago it was optional. nowadays internet is used more in phones, as compare to computersbut if you are in that 10% who do not understand aspect ratio, just google it- do not think that you are dumb. everyone is weak at something. it is better to gain knowledge about them asap. now we will move forward to the next one which i have written here. if a page is inside a directory, we need to make sure that the link we are using is for the correct page\". what do i mean by thisand it is href attribute & absolute and relative links. now we will talk about the \"image tags\". image tag is very simple & straight forward. they are used to add images in your html page. it means if you want to add images in your html page so you can use the img tag theres also it is attribute, which is src, which tell you which image you want to add, or the complete address of the image, for egi have already told you in my notes with the help of tag. tag is used to create line breaks in html, which means if you want \"this is bold\", \"this is italic\" & \"this is underline\" in different lines, so you must use tag is an empty tagin. cake. if you want to add chocolate or cake, just like these ingredients, you have to add html tags in html web page. now, just like you make food, theres a recipe. you add the ingredients accordingly. it is not like you added 10 tsp chilli powder and 20 tsp salt. theres a sequence in the recipe which we have to follow, just like theres a sequence of using html tags, you have to add those tags accordingly. now look, html stands for hypertext markup language. html is the language of the web. it is used to create websites. we use html tags to define look & feel of the website. with understanding of these tags and how to put them together, we can create beautiful websites easily. we can create a very beautiful website with understanding these tags if we know how we can use these tags together so we can make very beautiful websites. just like i made \"codewithharycom\", i definitely used my html knowledge while creating it. html knowledge will definitely be used while creating any type of website. the biggest question people will have in their mind is: \"if html is enough, so why we need css & js? \"let suppose if you forget to check those options so you run it again, just like me, you will not face any loss. you will not lose any important file. i will not launch itbecause title is the main thing which is shown in the search. if you come across a good title, so theres high chances that you will click on that, because the very step is to click on to the website and if you will only read the content when you will find it useful, if you do not click on the website and your website does not have ctr (click through rate)now, as i opened this tag, now i have to close this tag too. we have to open almost all html tags and we also have to close them. there are a few tags which does not need to be closed and those tags are called empty tags. but most of the tags which we use in the page & which contains the content. we have to close those type of tags. i have added opened \"head\" tag & then \"title\" tagso. whenever you are creating a serious website, this website not a serious one, i am just creating it to teach you. if you are creating a web-page for college fest or to collect information about your classmates or a group of your company, if you are doing stuff like this, then it is not a serious website. but if you are starting a blog and you want to generate your living from that, then thats a serious businessso, look, i have not added anything. in the header for now i will write \"this is header\" and in footer i will write \"this is footer\". i will save it & open it with live server and my website will open in live server and, as you can see, \"this header\", \"this is the main content\", & they must have added this in their meta tag. now, look, if i open this website, then theres high chance that they must have added met description and you can see that they have added meta tag for description. we have got a lot of types of meta tags, but you must set the meta tag for description. theres no guarantee about your content displaying here, as is it. google will use your meta description only when it will find it usable. i am telling you this with my experience. i have noticed this from all the websites which i build & appeared on. google now \"set a nice url slug\". what does this meanthe equation is now displayed correctly: ( c + o₂ ➜ co₂ )\"backgroundred\". and then i will close it in this way and when i will minify it. so, look, it has removed all the spaces & new lines. if a bigger css files contains a lot of spaces, so size of that file will increase and this website remove all of them. and when we write html or css code in this format, we add more spaces & new lines because we have to increase the readability. we do the format document to increase the readability so that when we or our fellow programmer read this code or tries to improve this code so he will not find this code difficult to read & rubbish. so we want to avoid these type of things. but when computer read this file- so you can give a compressed file which means you can remove these new lines & extra spacesif- theres an anchor tag and you are specifying the href attribute and writing it is value in it. so first the name of the attribute and then, after \" = \", the value of attribute in double quotes (\" \") or single quotes(\\' \\'), and then you can write the tag as usual. now i have written here. we either use single quotes (\\' \\') or double quotes (\" \") in attribute, and now comes the heading tag. lets discuss the heading tag. whenever you build your website or any page of your website, then you would like to give it a heading. heading tag is used to mark headings in html. if you want to make any text a headingnow open this and i will provide you a new text document. after writing \"new text document\", i will write \"notepadhtml\". i will do one thing for now. i will just change it to \"notepadtxt\" and i will add some html code. in iti have told you it is used to add paragraph and how you can add paragraph. and if you want to change the paragraph, so you can change it like this: when i will write \"lorem34\", so 34 words will appear. by the way, look, a horizontal scroll bar has appeared here, and if you want a view like this instead of this horizontal scroll bar, let me show you what i am talking about now. if we click on \"toggle word wrap\" so this scroll bar will disappear and line no will appear, which means in actual, this is not the line #17, but only this content is line #17, but this is displaying you in multiple lines so you do not have to scroll it horizontally. this is called word wrap and we can see the word wrap functionality in a lot of idesthis is the paragraph, but i will go to my would iv\\' tag. the would iv\\' tag was inside the main tag. i have added that in section look how much this would iv\\' should occupy spacethis is the equation of carbon oxidization, so we will write this. let me tell you how you can write this in a paragraph. you can write it ( c + o2 ➜ co2 ). if you write it like thisbut it is occupying the whole space. so would iv\\' element or would iv\\' like other element? wherever they step-in, the whole space belongs to them and span\\' is a, like an innocent boy, it only focus on. it is job and span\\' only occupy the space it needs. i will remove the paragraph from here because it is a block element and i will only keep the span\\' paragraph is a block element & span\\' is an in-line elementif. i do not type \"indexhtml\" in my url bar. even then i will get the same page: \"this is a heading, this is a paragraph\". if my page was not named \"indexhtml\". suppose if i rename this file- lets suppose if i rename it by pressing \"f2\" and if i give it any random name, if i give it \"thishtml\" instead of \"indexhtml\", you can name it after someones name. i will name it \"harryhtml\". will i be able to see anything after changing? it is name\"codewithhary\". so if you visit \"/blogs\", so you will be here, and if you visit \"/videos\", so you will be here. if you click on \"/contact me\", so you will be here. and if you click on \"/start watching\", so you will be here. when you visit \"/videos/java tutorial for beginners\", so you end up on this page. so they have added a mixture of absolute & relative links in the source of wikipedia, and your version of wikipedia is unable to find the relative links which are related to \"wikipediaorg\", but it is trying to find that pages on \"127.0.0:5500\". let me show you thisand i hope you have installed the vscode. we can use any text editor of our choice. once again, let me tell you here: i am using vscode because it is lightweight, open-source from microsoft. you just simply have to visit the google and search \"vscode\". just install it. like me, you can write html even in notepad text-editors like vscode, just make these things easier. we will see how vscode make these things easier. i will make this \"cwhhtml\" file a blank file. let me show you how vscode facilitate in a great we-development. if you add an \"exclamation mark\" ()i will open the pdf which i created for you and, as you can see, i have written about some basic tags here. we can add elements inside the body tag to define the page layout. we have learned that we have a body tags which is rendered by the body, and we can add some tags in that body tag which will be visible to us in the browser. we have learned about h1 tag\"this is a heading\" and after this i will write a paragraph: \"this is a paragraph\". and lets leave for now, for this heading & paragraph is because we just want to generate an html page and we want to open that in a \"live server\" because we want to see how our page will look in our server. look, as i opened this in a \"live server\". so what is written in the url \"127.0.0.1:5500\", which is a server created by \"live server\" extension. after creating this server. it is displaying \"indexhtml\" page through this server. but listen to me carefully: if i do not write this \"indexhtml\", then what will happenh1 for the bigger heading & h6 for the smaller? we do not have to do this, and we have to use the heading carefully. we have to write the paragraph with the paragraph tag and we have to write the headings with the heading tag. we have to use them carefully. now, look, i have told you about paragraphs, anchors and all that. now lets move back to the notes. i have written something here which i have just told you note-let me show you a would iv\\' and then i will show you a span\\'. would iv\\' is a container and span\\' is also a container. i will write \"i am a span tag here\". herehow we do content optimization: writing content according to \"which content is being search for how many time\". this also comes under seo, but we will not focus on that aspect. we will look for the existing, which already have written how to add seo in that page. how can we improve the ranking of that website? by adding more html tags & optimization, and not by any illegal means. we will actually provide value to our users, and how will we do. thatlets suppose if you install the third party javascript library or if you use third-party css frame work, it is possible that they have targeted some particular tags like header or footer, and you are not using that layout, so maybe you will face problems while using that library. thats why i am suggesting better user experience. so now we will learn how to create a layout of a website. ideally, your website will contain a header and then a main tag and a footerwe will create that through css & js bur. now we are only learning html, so thats why we will first finish this html step and then we will move to the responsiveness. you can use \"inspect elements\" & \"view page source\" and html elements = start tag + content + end tagyou do not have to learn these things. i am just showing you after removing the css style sheets. and look after removing css style sheets. this is how it looks. now you do not have to learn how to remove style sheets, because i am going to teach you thisyou have to maintain the consistency. if you are using the single quotes(\\' \\'), then keep using them, and if you are using the double quotes (\" \"), then keep using them. so i will remove these double quotes (\" \") from here, because here the url of the website is this one & it does not contain the double quotes (\" \")i am going to add a sub heading in it and the main reason. lets suppose we are writing the main reasons and the paragraph, and lets suppose we have written 45 words in the main reasons. so when i will open my page in live server. so this is what it will look like. so theres a page headingyes, it is fine. i have changed it knowingly. now i will open it with notepad. i will open it simple notepad, which every computer have if you are using a mac or linux. so a basic editor is definitely shipped with each operating system. so lets move here & what we will doso. i hope you have understood how to write the absolute & relative urls. now we will move back to the notes and we will talk about the \"bold, italic & underline tags\". we can use \"bold, italic & underline tags\" to highlight our texts. so let me give you a demo of \"bold, italic & underline tags\". so i will write \"bold, italic & underline tags\"so look, i have been redirected to \"codewithharrycom\". so it does not matter if theres an image or a text, you will be redirected to the website in a new tab. i hope that this was easy. now, if i also add height here. let me take you to the note. i have written something: \"if the page is inside the directory, we need to make sure that we link to the correct page\"lets suppose you want to show \"human image\". i know this is very weird, but \"alt\" means the text that should be shown when the image is unable to load. if i change this to \"unsplash4.com\", so this image might not load and i will be able to see \"human image\", which means the \"alt\". and now if i fix the url, which i messed up so, as i will save it, then i will not be able to see the \"alt\", which means the text in the \"alt\" will only be shown when the image is unable to be load\"playing audio\", \"main tag\", \"semantic tag\", \"seo\". there are a lot of thing which people usually miss. i am going to cover all these topics in this video and i will make you a successful + profitable html developer, so that you can get a good starter and you can build good websites. now i want to tell you difference between html, css & js with an analogy: html is like a human skeleton and css is just like the skin on the skeleton. this means it beautifies that. css do the same work on html, just like skin do on our skeleton. our skin provides help to our skeleton to look good and css helps the html to look beautiful. just like our brain impart the logic in us, just like that js provides logic to website made with htmli mean logic when to put break & at how much pressure. how to change the gears. what will happen after changing the gear? take this as an example of javascript. what will happen when the user will change the gear? now suppose there is a car which looks good but its break does not function & it is engine is also broken, so that car is also useless. so this is role of html, css & js on a website. the html is the frame of a website, css is the decoration and javascript is the frontend logic. why am i referring it as frontend logic? so javascript is a type of client side logic, which means the logic that user can also see, and backend logic is always hidden from us, the server from where this website is coming. for example, my website was designed in django, so what logic is djangos backend is using? i will never know, i can only see the logic of frontend. i can see it is logic that how is it functioning=? \"cwhjfif \" and in alt i will write \"harrys website\". so i will cut this and i will save it. and let me add width attribute \"width = 123\" and image have width & height, both attributes. we will talk about this soon. but the point i want highlight here. let me show that firstyou are commanding \"https//\", which means theres a website on internet, \"codewithharry\" redirect on that. so these two are different. the difference is in this: you can visit globally from any computer, but in this you can only visit when you are in a same server, which means you have to only use the relative link when you are in your server. actually, i am using live server+ /\" to do comment & uncomment. comment means to comment any text, uncomment means to uncomment any text which is already commented. commenting-uncommenting- and we will use this terminology a lot while programming. i will leave \"improve below paragraph\" & \"this heading will be changed in future\". i will leave all these as they are and read the next point. \"case sensitivity\" is html, a case sensitive language, and this is how you can write tag. and wherever you will add tag, a new line will be added. i will expect a new line after \"this is bold\" and \"this is italic\"anchor tag is used to add links to an existing content inside an html page, which means if you want to add links in an html page. it means if you want to redirect the user to a different page within the site or you want to redirect the user globally to a different website, so you can. the anchor tag, just like i have added an absolute url here of \"codewithharrycom\", so if someone clicks on this, so they will be redirected to the harrys website. if i write \"href = /abouthtml\"yes, definitely, i was able, and when you will learn the css, then you will know how many options you have to solve this question. and when you will learn the css, you will find that you can change the size of any element and when you can do that. so sometimes you become too greedy to use the easy tags, just like changing the font & paragraphi have closed it mistakenly. thats good that i managed to saved it. i have saved it & look how this page is rendering. h1 will look like this and may be. this too is h1, i have written h1 twice, if i am not wrongi hope you have understood the html and in future i will upload a course for css with notes- and please do tell in the comments if you want that too- and in that we will learn how to make websites. we will learn to create good websites, templates. and cssh1 has the opening & closing tags with content in between, just like that \"paragraph\" has the opening & closing tags with content in between. we have understood this. most of the html elements have opening & closing tags with content in between. we have discussed this: \"some html tags have no content\". there are some html tags which does not contain any content. for egas i have used this \"cwhjfif\". lets suppose this is inside a folder with name \"img\". suppose i have moved all my images to the img folder. let us say i am using 100 images in this particular website and i do not want a bundles of images here in my directory.'"

मैं आपको बता रहा हूं कि वेबसाइट 100% अच्छी नहीं दिखेगी क्योंकि ऐसी शैलियां हैं जिनका उपयोग मैं गंभीर जड़ों के माध्यम से कर रहा हूं अब हम इस पर चर्चा नहीं करेंगे, हम बस यह ध्यान रखेंगे कि किसी भी वेबसाइट के पेज सोर्स को देखना इतना आसान नहीं है, यह कोड है और इसे नोटपैड में पेस्ट करें और हम उस वेबसाइट को कॉपी कर सकते हैं, यह संभव नहीं है लेकिन हो सकता है हो सकता है एक नजर डालते हैं, इसलिए मैंने इसे सेव कर लिया है दायीं ओर क्लिक करके इसे नोटपैड से खोला है, अनुमान लगाएं कि यह कौन सा टैग होगा यह निश्चित रूप से एक हेडिंग टैग है जिसका आप निरीक्षण कर सकते हैं और यह h1 टैग होगा यह इस पृष्ठ का प्राथमिक शीर्षक है इसलिए यह h1 टैग होगा मान लीजिए कि आप करेंगे यह h1 किसी भी पृष्ठ में नहीं मिला है, इसलिए उस पृष्ठ के डेवलपर ने गलती की है क्योंकि यदि आपने शीर्षक टैग का उपयोग अपने शीर्षक में भी नहीं किया है, तो आपके पृष्ठ में कुछ गड़बड़ है, आपका पृष्ठ शीर्षक टैग का उपयोग किए बिना सीएसएस का उपयोग करके प्रदर्शित किया जा सकता है लेकिन इसे सर्वोत्तम अभ्यास नहीं कहा जाएगा आपको इसे एक अच्छे अभ्यास के साथ करना होगा यदि आप वेबसाइट या ऐप बनाने के लिए सर्वोत्तम सॉफ्टवेयर तकनीकों का उपयोग करते हैं तो आपको लाभ मिलेगा मैं अभी आपको यह बताना चाहता हूं मैं इसे बंद कर दूंगा क्योंकि हमारा अध्याय -2 अभ्यास सेट पूरा हो गया है मैंने कुछ प्रश्न भी हाथ से लिए हैं ताकि आप अध्याय -2 को पूरा करने के बाद अपना अभ्यास कर सकें मैं बस इन नोट्स को रखना चाहता हूं जैसे कि आपके पास ये नोट्स और यह वीडियो है तो जब भी आप पृष्ठ को पलटेंगे आपको सब कुछ याद रहेगा और मैंने अभ्यास भी किया है ताकि अगर आपको कभी रिवीजन करना पड़े तो आपको बस कुछ पन्ने पलटने होंगे अब हम अध्याय-3 की ओर बढ़ेंगे और अध्याय-3 में हम सीखेंगे कि हम एक वेबसाइट कैसे बना सकते हैं क्योंकि अगर आप एक वेबसाइट की संरचना करना सीख जाते हैं तो आप आसानी से किसी भी प्रकार की वेबसाइट बना सकते हैं, इसलिए आपको इसका url \"img/cwh\" जोड़ना होगाjfif\" जिसका अर्थ है कि img फोल्डर btw में आप अपनी पसंद के इस फोल्डर को नाम दे सकते हैं, इसे \"img\" नाम देना अनिवार्य नहीं है, आप इसे \"हैरी\" भी नाम दे सकते हैं, io ने इसे \"img\" नाम दिया है क्योंकि मैं आसानी से पहचान सकता हूँ कि इसमें शामिल है छवियां और यह त्रुटि ठीक हो जाएगी, इसलिए चिंता करने की कोई बात नहीं है, मैं सिर्फ आपको बताना चाहता था क्योंकि यह ज्यादातर तब उपयोग किया जाता है जब आप फ्रेम वर्क का उपयोग करेंगेयदि आप फ्लास्क, django, कोणीय या दृश्य का उपयोग करते हैं, तो आपको दिन के अंत में इन चीजों का सामना करना पड़ेगा, ये सभी फ्रेम वर्क html को प्रस्तुत करते हैं, इसलिए हमने यह और यह सीखा है और हमने सीखा है कि हम एंकर टैग में img टैग का उपयोग कर सकते हैं और हम झुक गए हैं कि हम ऊंचाई और चौड़ाई से केवल एक विशेषता सेट कर सकते हैं और दूसरा स्वचालित रूप से सेट हो जाएगा और हमने यह भी सीखा है कि हम एकल (\\'_\\') या दोहरे उद्धरण (\"_) से किसी एक का उपयोग कर सकते हैं] \") क्योंकि यह निरंतरता को बढ़ाता है और आप नहीं चाहते कि अन्य डेवलपर्स आपको खराब शब्दों में याद रखें, आप चाहते हैं कि वे आपको अच्छे शब्दों में याद रखें और आप सबसे आसान तरीके से एक अच्छा कोड लिखना चाहते हैं और यदि आप कोड को बनाए रख रहे हैं आपका अपना तो यह इसे सही ढंग से बनाए रखने के लिए एक कारण बढ़ाता है अब हम बात करेंगे iv\\' और क्या iv\\' टैग का उपयोग अन्य तत्वों के लिए एक कंटेनर के रूप में किया जाता है इसका क्या मतलब है? इसलिए मैं इसे इस तरह से ज़ूम कर सकता हूं ताकि हम इन सभी चीजों को सीख सकें vscode का उपयोग करें या मैं कहूंगा कि इन सुविधाओं का आनंद लेने के लिए हम vscode का उपयोग करते हैं क्योंकि हम जाते हैं vscode में बहुत सी चीजें हैं और फ़ॉन्ट आकार बदलने के लिए नोटपैड में कुछ भी नहीं है, आपको बहुत सारी कुंजियों को दबाना होगा, इसलिए हम नोटपैड का उपयोग नहीं करेंगे, लेकिन हम निश्चित रूप से नोटपैड का उपयोग कर सकते हैं, हमें बस यह समझना है कि चीजों को कैसे करना है, अब हम आगे बढ़ेंगे अध्याय-1 में जहां हम अपनी पहली वेबसाइट बनाएंगे, हम विभिन्न प्रकार की चीजें सीखेंगे और \"indexhtml\" और हम पृष्ठ संरचना के बारे में जानेंगे कि एक बुनियादी वेब पेज संरचना क्या है, अब हम अध्याय -1 पर चलते हैं तो दोस्तों अब हम अध्याय -1 पर जाएंगे, सबसे पहले हम इसे खोलेंगे और अध्याय -1 \"पहले वेबसाइट बनाना\" है जो हमें बताएगी कि हम अपनी वेबसाइट कैसे बना सकते हैं तो इसे शुरू करने से पहले मैं आपको बता दूं कि हर वेबसाइट html से बनी होती है और हम \"index\" नाम की एक फाइल बनाकर वेबसाइट बनाना शुरू करते हैं।html\" तो मैं अपना vscode खोलूंगा और मेरा vscode इस फ़ोल्डर में किस फ़ोल्डर में खोला गया है?\"बस \\'एंटर\\' दबाएं और बाकी मैं देख लूंगा\" एम्मेट इतना अच्छा है कि इस दुनिया में एम्मेट जैसे बहुत कम लोग हैं बस \"h1\" लिखें और फिर \"किताबों की सूची\" आपने \"किताबों की सूची\" लिखी है या मैं लिखूंगा \"पुस्तकें पढ़ने के लिए\" \"पुस्तकें पढ़ने के लिए\" लिखें मैं जो भी शीर्षक जोड़ना चाहता हूं वह लिखूंगा और फिर मैं \"पी\" लिखूंगा और फिर मैं लिखूंगा \"आपके लिए पढ़ने के लिए बहुत सारी किताबें हैं\" और अब मैं करूँगा इसे सेव करें और फिर मैं इसे लाइव सर्वर के साथ खोलूंगा और आप जानते हैं कि क्या होगा और यह लीवर सर्वर में खुल जाएगा और फिर मैं इस शीर्षक और पैराग्राफ को भी देख पाऊंगा तो देखिए मैंने एक ओपनिंग टैग और एक क्लोजिंग टैग लिखा है और फिर सामग्री से क्या मतलब है के बीच में एक सामग्री? और मैं इस अध्याय 0 पीडीएफ को यहां खोलूंगा और जैसा कि आप देख सकते हैं कि मैंने \"अध्याय 0 परिचय\" लिखा है html = हाइपरटेक्स्ट मार्कअप लैंग्वेज और html वेब की भाषा है जिसका उपयोग इसे बनाने के लिए किया जाता है वेबसाइटें यदि आप कभी किसी वेबसाइट पर गए हैं तो मान लें कि \"wwwcodewithharryकॉम\" यदि आप कभी किसी वेबसाइट पर जाते हैं और फिर आप \"पृष्ठ स्रोत देखें\" पर जाते हैं, तो आप इस वेबसाइट का वास्तविक स्रोत देख पाएंगे, आप यह देख पाएंगे कि यह वेबसाइट कैसे बनाई गई थी, ऐसी कौन सी चीजें हैं जिनका उपयोग फ्रंटएंड में किया गया था उन्होंने किस प्रकार के टैग का उपयोग किया है और अब यदि आप html के बारे में नहीं जानते हैं तो हो सकता है कि आपको ये टैग बहुत अधिक लगें लेकिन मैं आपको बता दूं कि मैं आप सभी के लिए इन चीजों को बहुत आसान बनाने जा रहा हूं ताकि हम पूरी जानकारी ले सकें html से यह हाइपरटेक्स्ट मार्कअप भाषा है यह वेब की भाषा है जिसका अर्थ है कि आपको इसकी आवश्यकता होगीयदि आप सुंदर वेब पेज प्रदर्शित करना चाहते हैं तो इसका उपयोग वेबसाइट बनाने के लिए किया जाता है, हम वेबसाइट के रंगरूप को परिभाषित करने के लिए एचटीएमएल टैग का उपयोग करते हैं और वेबसाइट के रंगरूप को परिभाषित करते हैं, उदाहरण के लिए हम एचटीएमएल का उपयोग करते हैं।मैं इसी फ़ोल्डर को vscode में खोलूंगा क्योंकि यह अध्याय-2 का अभ्यास सेट है, मैं यहां \"chater_2_practice_set\" या \"practice_set\" नाम से एक फ़ाइल बनाऊंगाhtml\" मैं बॉयलर प्लेट कोड जोड़ूंगा और मैं इसे \"अध्याय 2 अभ्यास सेट\" नाम दूंगा और शरीर में मैं उस कोड को जोड़ने जा रहा हूं जिससे हम इस प्रश्न को हल करने जा रहे हैं, इसलिए यदि मैं प्राथमिक शीर्षक जोड़ना चाहता हूं तो यह निश्चित रूप से h1 होगा और मान लीजिए कि मैं पहाड़ों और उसके बाद के बारे में लिख रहा हूंहम कहते हैं, मैं द्वितीयक शीर्षक जोड़ रहा हूं और मैं \"क्यों पहाड़\" लिख रहा हूं और हम कहते हैं कि मैंने एक पैराग्राफ लिखा है जिसमें 45 शब्द हैं और मैं शब्द रैप को चालू करूंगा, इसलिए खोज इंजनों ने इसे हतोत्साहित करना शुरू कर दिया और उन्होंने फैसला नहीं किया \"मेटा नाम = कीवर्ड\" का उपयोग करने के लिए यह सब सामने आया और \"मेटा नाम = कीवर्ड्स\" के लिए कोई mdn लिंक नहीं है यदि आप इस पर होवर करते हैं तो आपको कोई mdn लिंक नहीं मिलेगा जो आपको मेटा तत्व के लिए मिलेगा लेकिन \"मेटा\" के लिए नहीं नाम = कीवर्ड\" और यही कारण है कि एमडीएन समुदाय ने भी इसका खंडन किया है, इसलिए मैं आपको कीवर्ड विवरण के बारे में बताना चाहता हूं, इसलिए मेटा कीवर्ड टैग सेट न करें क्योंकि लोगों ने इसका दुरुपयोग किया है और भले ही आप मीठे कीबोर्ड स्टैग जोड़ते हैं यदि आप एक जोड़ते हैं 2-3 कीवर्ड के साथ छोटा टैग तो मेरी राय में यह कोई समस्या नहीं है इसलिए अगला बिंदु मेटा लेखक टैग सेट करना है और हमें मेटा लेखक टैग सेट करना होगा क्योंकि यदि आप एक ब्लॉग लिख रहे हैं तो आपको इसके बारे में उल्लेख करना चाहिए लेखक और आपके उपयोगकर्ता भी au के बारे में जानना चाहेंगे थोर क्योंकि शायद वे अपने पसंदीदा लेखक की सामग्री को पढ़ने में रुचि रखते हैं और फिर हम \"पसंदीदा आइकन सेट करें\" पर जाएंगे और मैं आपको बता दूं कि पसंदीदा आइकन क्या है मैं \"पसंदीदा आइकन जनरेटर\" पर जाऊंगा और देखूंगा कि वे कैसे बता रहे हैं आप अपने पसंदीदा आइकन को मान सकते हैं कि मैं इस वेबसाइट पर जा रहा हूं और मैंने एक पसंदीदा आइकन डाउनलोड किया है, इसलिए डाउनलोड करने के बाद मैं इसे खोल दूंगा और मैं \"पसंदीदा आइकन निकालने\" करूंगा और आप देख सकते हैं कि इसने मुझे कुछ आइकन दिए हैं और मैं कर सकता हूं उन्हें एक fav आइकन के रूप में उपयोग करें और मैं एक कंटेनर में एक पैराग्राफ जोड़ रहा हूं जिसमें मैंने \"lorem34\" जोड़ा है जिसमें मैंने कुछ नमूना पाठ जोड़ा है और मैं आपको इस वेबसाइट को लाइव सर्वर में दिखाता हूं और यह हमारी वेबसाइट है और मैं इन सभी को बंद कर दूंगा लिंक और देखें कि मेरी वेबसाइट कैसी दिख रही है, अब हम कहते हैं कि मैं इस वेबसाइट में मेटा टैग जोड़ना चाहता हूं, मैंने पहले ही शीर्षक जोड़ दिया है, अगर मैं इसमें केवल एसईओ जोड़ता हूं तो हम कहते हैं कि मैं एसईओ के बारे में बात कर रहा हूं, यह नहीं है बिल्कुल उपयुक्त शीर्षक क्योंकि अगर आप SEO की बात कर रहे हैं तो t लिखें उसका इस तरह से \"एसईओ: एक शुरुआती गाइड\" 2021 में एसईओ: एक शुरुआती गाइड \"2022 में एसईओ: एक शुरुआती गाइड\" इसलिए यदि कोई \"2021 में एसईओ कैसे बदलेगा\" की खोज करता है और आपका लेख उस सामग्री के लिए जानकारी प्रदान कर रहा है उच्च संभावना है कि उपयोगकर्ता उस पर क्लिक करेगा, इसलिए आपके पृष्ठ में बहुत क्लिक करने योग्य शीर्षक होना चाहिए और आपके शीर्षक से संबंधित सामग्री इस पृष्ठ में कुछ भी नहीं है, यह बड़ा है या यह छोटा है मैं \"छोटा\" जोड़ूंगा \" यह छोटा है\" यह छोटा है और जैसा कि आप देख सकते हैं कि मुझे अलग-अलग आकार के बड़े और छोटे मिल गए हैं और अब इसके बाद हम बात करेंगे कि आप html में एक क्षैतिज विभाजक कैसे जोड़ सकते हैं और इसके लिए टैग कर सकते हैं क्योंकि मैं आपको इन विषयों को समझा रहा हूं जैसा कि मैंने शीर्षक और अनुच्छेद के विषय की व्याख्या की है, मैं \"शीर्षक और अनुच्छेद\" लिखूंगा और मैं इसे टिप्पणी करूंगा और 7 अनुच्छेद शीर्षक के बाद मैंने आपको लिंक के बारे में समझाया, मैं चाहता हूं कि मैं उन्हें एक क्षैतिज रेखा से अलग कर दूं और फिर मैंने आपको समझाया छवि टैग के बारे में आपको चिंतित होने की आवश्यकता नहीं है के बारे में मैं सिर्फ आपको यह दिखाने के लिए सीएसएस जोड़ रहा हूं कि आप किसी विशेष के बीजी को कैसे बदल सकते हैं iv\\' मैंने एक विशेष होगा iv\\' बीजी को \\'बैंगनी\\' में बदल दिया है और दूसरा iv \\'डी\\' है तो यह है कि मैं कैसे शैलियों को जोड़ सकते हैं और शैलियों को जोड़ने के लिए मैंने उन्हें विभाजित किया है ये 2 एक साथ हैं और ये 2 एक साथ हैं अब हम इन-लाइन और ब्लॉक तत्वों के बारे में बात करेंगे कि इन-लाइन तत्व क्या है? हम एक फ़ॉरवर्ड स्लैश (/) जोड़ते हैं और हम लिखते हैं उस टैग का नाम जिसका अर्थ है और यह एक क्लोजिंग टैग बन जाता है हम सभी टैग्स को html में खोलेंगे और बंद करेंगे हम html एलिमेंट्स बनाएंगे यहां मैं राइट क्लिक करूंगा> कोड के साथ ओपन करें और यह फोल्डर vscode में ओपन हो गया है इसलिए अब देखिए मैंने इस फोल्डर को vscode में खोल दिया है अब हम यहां एक वेबसाइट बनाएंगे और html पेज का नाम \"इंडेक्स\" होगाhtml\" स्पष्ट कारणों से अब मैं विस्मयादिबोधक चिह्न (!) जोड़ूंगा जब भी Google जैसे खोज इंजन आपके पृष्ठ को पढ़ेंगे तो वे सोचेंगेकि आप h1 में सबसे महत्वपूर्ण शीर्षक लिख रहे हैं और उसके बाद जैसे आप h2, h3, h4 का उपयोग कर रहे हैंआप महत्व कम कर रहे हैं जिसका अर्थ है कि यदि आपने \"पढ़ने के लिए पुस्तकें\" के लिए h1 का उपयोग किया है, तो खोज इंजन सोचेगा या कोई भी बॉट जो आपकी वेबसाइट को क्रॉल कर रहा है, वह सोचेगा कि h1 आपके पृष्ठ का प्राथमिक विषय है, इसलिए आपको इसका उपयोग करना होगा एच 1h6 टैग बहुत बुद्धिमानी से यदि आप खोज इंजन अनुकूलन चाहते हैं और यदि आप अपने पृष्ठों की सामग्री को किसी बॉट, क्रॉलर या किसी खोज इंजन के साथ आसानी से व्यक्त करना चाहते हैं तो टैग का बुद्धिमानी से उपयोग करें आपको कभी भी h1-h6 टैग का उपयोग आकार को परिभाषित करने के लिए नहीं करना होगा शीर्षक मैंने कुछ ऐसे लोगों को देखा है जिन्होंने हाल ही में एचटीएमएल सीखा है, उदाहरण के लिए शीर्षक के आकार को परिभाषित करने के लिए एच 1-एच 6 टैग का उपयोग करेंमान लें कि मुझे एक विशेष खंड में एक पैराग्राफ और एक शीर्षक पैक करना है, मान लीजिए कि मैं एक और खंड बना रहा हूं और मुझे अलग-अलग शीर्षक और पैराग्राफ जोड़ने हैं, मान लीजिए कि मुझे एच 1 चुनना है और मैं लिखूंगा \"व्हाई लव एचटीएमएल\" और फिर मैं यहां एक पैराग्राफ लिखूंगा, मैं लिखूंगा \"एचटीएमएल एक बहुत अच्छी भाषा है और इसने मेरे जीवन को उलटा कर दिया है\" मैं ऐसा कुछ लिखूंगा और कोई भी एचटीएमएल डेवलपर जो एचटीएमएल से प्यार करता है, वह इसे लिखेगा, मैं सिर्फ एक उदाहरण ले रहा हूं और यह है ऐसा नहीं है कि आप कुछ भी लिख सकते हैं और आपका पृष्ठ शीर्ष पर पॉप होगा मैंने यह लिखा है और अब हम यहां मेटा टैग जोड़ेंगे अब देखें \"पोर्ट देखें\" के लिए पहले से ही एक मेटा टैग है, मैं \"मेटा\" और फिर \"डेस्क\" लिखूंगा और फिर मैं SEO के बारे में लिखूंगा SEO जैसा हैमान लीजिए मैं कुछ भी लिखूंगायह seo पर एक अच्छा लेख है यदि आप css नहीं जानते हैं तो इसे बाद में एक शॉट दें मैंने अभी के लिए css पर वीडियो बनाए हैं बस html पर ध्यान केंद्रित करें और मैं चाहता हूं कि यह div लाल रंग का हो मैं आपको दिखा रहा हूं लेकिन यह मत सोचिए कि आप ऐसा नहीं है कि मैं इस पृष्ठ को सहेज लूंगा और परिवर्तन स्वचालित रूप से प्रतिबिंबित होंगे और मुझे इसे (ctrl + स्क्रॉल) के साथ रीसेट करने दें अब मान लीजिए कि मैं इस iv के बीजी को बदलना चाहता हूं \\'डी हैं\\' मैं यह कैसे कर रहा हूं? नहीं, आप सीएसएस के माध्यम से बीजी रंग बदल सकते हैं लेकिन जावास्क्रिप्ट के साथ आप यह भी नियंत्रित कर सकते हैं कि जावास्क्रिप्ट के साथ आप कुछ भी छिपाने या दिखाने के लिए चुन सकते हैं और जावास्क्रिप्ट की मदद से आप जितने चाहें उतने मिनट के लिए हम इन सभी चीजों को सीखेंगे और आप जानते हैं जब मैं पृष्ठ को फिर से लोड करूंगा तो ये चीजें अपनी जगह पर होंगी, अब एक सुंदर सादृश्य पर एक नज़र डालते हैं जो मैंने लिखा है यह एक बहुत अच्छा सादृश्य है इसलिए मैं इसे \"सुंदर\" के रूप में संदर्भित करता हूं यदि html आपकी कारों का शरीर है तो हमें मान लें आप एक कार निर्माता हैं यदि आप नहीं हैं, तो बस मान लीजिए और अब मैं तलाश करूंगा h youtube पर एक वीडियो के लिए जो कार निर्माण से संबंधित है और मेरे पास कार निर्माण से संबंधित एक वीडियो है अब इन कारों को देखें उनके बिना रंगे शरीर को देखें बस उन शरीर को html के रूप में लें और अब अगर मैं इसे पेंट करता हूं और कुछ डिज़ाइन बनाता हूंइसमें टेल लाइट्स, हेडलैंप्स में कुछ डिज़ाइन की हुई लाइटें जोड़ें और एक अच्छा विंड शील्ड लगाएं और इसे ऐसा बनाएं कि जो भी इसे देखे वह इसके डिज़ाइन से चकित हो जाए क्योंकि अब कोई भी इस कार के डिज़ाइन से चकित नहीं होगा, यहाँ कार हैं, जैसे स्पोर्ट कार आप उनके डिजाइन से चकित हो जाएंगे, इसलिए यदि आप इस प्रकार की कारों को देखते हैं तो सबसे पहले इसका फ्रेम है और साथ ही उन्होंने इसे इस तरह से डिजाइन किया है कि एचटीएमएल के साथ आप अपनी वेबसाइट के फ्रेम को डिजाइन करते हैं और फिर आप इसे सीएसएसआई के साथ डिजाइन करते हैं संक्षेप में एसईओ के बारे में बताया और यदि आप एक वेब डेवलपर हैं तो आप किसी भी समय एसईओ सीखना चाहते हैं, मैं आपको बताता हूं कि मैंने अपने जीवन में एसईओ के बारे में क्या सीखा है, मैं आपको बहुत कम अवधि में बताऊंगा लेकिन यह बहुत ही उपयोगी होगा मेरी राय में प्रभावी एक सीमा में एसईओ का उपयोग करना अच्छा है लेकिन एसईओ एक वेबसाइट की तरह उपयोग करने के बारे में नहीं हैमैं आपको दिखाता हूं कि मैं किस प्रकार की वेबसाइट के बारे में बात कर रहा हूं, अगर मैं इस वेबसाइट को लाइव सर्वर में खोलता हूं, अगर आप Google पर वीडियो खोजते हैं, अगर मैं Google पर वीडियो खोजता हूं तो जब भी आप किसी टैग के बारे में अधिक जानकारी प्राप्त करना चाहते हैं तो आप इसके mdn संदर्भ पर जा सकते हैं और वहां आप उस टैग के बारे में सब कुछ तैयार कर सकते हैं यदि आप एक अग्रिम उपयोगकर्ता हैं तो आप इसे समझेंगे लेकिन यदि आप शुरुआती हैं तो डरें नहीं उन्होंने यहां थोड़ा डेमो दिया है तो बस इसे देखें या मैं नोट्स में सब कुछ शामिल किया है और इस वीडियो में चिंता करने की कोई बात नहीं थी, थी या होगी और हम यहां सभी तनावों और परेशानियों को शूट करने के लिए हैं, अब मैंने आपको लिंक विशेषता के बारे में बताया है कि एक नए टैब में कैसे खोलें और मैं आपको यह भी बताया है कि हम किसी भी सामग्री को एक एंकर टैग के अंदर रख सकते हैं जैसे चित्र और शीर्षक अभी के लिए मैंने अभी एक पाठ जोड़ा है लेकिन अगर कोई छवि थी तो आप \"कोडविथरी\" पर भी जा सकते हैंकॉम\" उस छवि पर क्लिक करके लेकिन मैं चाहता हूं कि आप इसे अपने दम पर करें क्योंकि यदि आप किसी वेबसाइट का निरीक्षण करते हैं तो पहले ले जाएं आपको मिलेगाकि आप अपनी पसंदीदा वेबसाइटों को बदलना सीखेंगे और वह कोई भी वेबसाइट हो सकती है, मैं \"कोडविथरी\" वेबसाइट बदलूंगा, इसलिए अब हम \"कोडविथरी\" पर हैंकॉम\" और मैं आपको इसे उस तरह से बदलते हुए दिखाऊंगा जिस तरह से मैंने पहले ही एक बार किया था मान लीजिए कि मैं \"मुझसे संपर्क करें\" बदलना चाहता हूं और मैं इसे बदलना चाहता हूं\"इस व्यक्ति से संपर्क करें\" तो यह है कि मैं इसे कैसे बदल सकता हूं और इसे बदलने के लिए अपने प्रयास पर इसे सुनिश्चित करना सुनिश्चित करें, इस वेबसाइट को बदलना महत्वपूर्ण नहीं है और मुझे पता है कि आप में से 90% \"कोडविथरी\" को बदल देंगे, किसी अन्य वेबसाइट को आजमाएं आप कुछ भी बदल सकते हैं या आप \"कोडविथरी अपनी पसंदीदा वेबसाइट को बदलने की कोशिश कर सकते हैं, यह बहुत मजेदार है जब वेब पेज बदला जाता है तो बहुत कम लोग इससे परिचित होते हैं और जो जानते हैं कि यह उनके लिए अच्छा है, अपनी पसंदीदा वेबसाइट पर जाएं और कोशिश करें पृष्ठ स्रोत देखें और कोड की सटीक पंक्तियां लिखें क्या यह वेबसाइट क्लोन करता है? इसे बॉयलर प्लेट कोड कहा जाता है एचटीएमएल का बॉयलर प्लेट कोड यहां दिखाई देगा और मैं इसे \"अध्याय -3\" नाम से बनाऊंगा अब मैं क्या करूंगाजैसा कि मैंने आपको एक हेडर टैग के बारे में बताया है, मैंने यहां एक हेडर टैग का उपयोग किया है और फिर मैं यहां एक मुख्य टैग का उपयोग करूंगा और फिर मैं यहां एक पैराग्राफ जोड़ूंगा और मैं लिखूंगा \"यह मुख्य सामग्री है\" और दबाने के बाद (ctrl + दर्ज करें) और मैंने अध्याय-2 पीडीएफ भी खोला है, इससे कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता कि हमने बड़े, छोटे, पूर्व, सबस्क्रिप्ट और सुपरस्क्रिप्ट टैग के बारे में बहुत सी चीजें सीखी हैं और मुझे लगता है कि यह मजेदार था क्योंकि हमने एक बनाना सीखा है वेबसाइट अब हम क्या करेंगे, हम कुछ सवाल करेंगे ताकि आप html पर मजबूती से पकड़ बना सकें और जो भी टैग, गुण और विशेषता हमने सीखी है, उसके बारे में आप बेहतर समझ सकें, इसलिए पहला सवाल है, \"एक html पेज बनाएं एक शीर्षक के साथ\" जो पृष्ठ का शीर्षक होने जा रहा है क्योंकि आप चाहते हैं कि ट्रैफ़िक आपकी वेबसाइट पर आए यदि आप एक ब्लॉगर हैं या आप किसी भी प्रकार की सेवा प्रदान करते हैं तो आप चाहते हैं कि आपकी वेबसाइट पर ट्रैफ़िक आए और आप चाहते हैं कि लोग आगे आएं आपकी वेबसाइट और आपकी कड़ी मेहनत की सराहना करते हैं इसलिए हमने टी के बारे में सीखा है वह इंडेक्स करता है और अब हम अध्याय -3 नोट्स पर वापस जाएंगे और हम सीखेंगे कि इन 3 टैग्स का उपयोग कैसे करें, इसलिए हम हेडर में नेविगेशन बार जोड़ते हैं और हम इसमें एनएवी टैग जोड़ते हैं और मुख्य टैग्स में हम \"सेक्शन\" जोड़ते हैं। article\" और \"aside\" टैग और ये तीन टैग सबसे अधिक उपयोग किए जाने वाले टैग हैं जिन्हें आप \"div\" जोड़ सकते हैं यहां हम बाद में \"div\" के बारे में और जानेंगे लेकिन ये 3 सबसे महत्वपूर्ण टैग हैं जिनके बारे में आपको जानकारी होनी चाहिए ये शुरुआती हैं और मुख्य टैग के समापन टैग मूल रूप से हमने शीर्षलेख, पादलेख और मुख्य टैग के बारे में बात की है \"यह बोल्ड है\" \"यह इटैलिक है\" और \"यह रेखांकित है\" एक पंक्ति में दिखाई देता है जिसका अर्थ है कि अगर मैं यहां एक नई पंक्ति जोड़ता हूं तब भी यह नई लाइन प्रदर्शित नहीं होगी क्योंकि आप देख सकते हैं कि नई लाइन प्रदर्शित नहीं हुई है और मैंने पृष्ठ को सहेजा भी है, भले ही मैं कई नई लाइनें जोड़ दूं, यह इसे प्रभावित नहीं करेगा\" या अगर मैं कुछ अतिरिक्त स्थान जोड़ता हूंदेखो मैंने यहाँ कितने अतिरिक्त जोड़े हैं मैंने लिखा है \"यह इटैलिक है\" और यहाँ क्या प्रस्तुत किया गया है? मुझे नहीं पता कि आप यहाँ जावास्क्रिप्ट क्यों लिख सकते हैं मैं आपको बताऊँगा कि ये चीजें वास्तव में कैसे काम करती हैं इसलिए मैं अपना जावास्क्रिप्ट कंसोल खोलूँगा जहाँ मैं अपना जावास्क्रिप्ट लिख सकता हूं और यहां मैं जल्दी से \"दस्तावेज़\" लिखूंगातनशैलीपृष्ठभूमि का रंग = \"लाल\"; मैं दोहराता हूं कि मैंने यह पंक्ति लिखी है जो कहती हैशरीर की पृष्ठभूमि डी \\'को चालू करें और देखो जैसे मैं जावास्क्रिप्ट इंजेक्ट करते समय \"एंटर\" दबाता हूं, यह मोड़ डी \\'है और इन चीजों को कैसे निष्पादित किया जाए? मैं नीचे की ओर बढ़ूंगा और \"मुख्य\" के बाद मैं एक पाद लेख बनाऊंगा और जैसा कि आप इन टैग्स को बनाएंगे vscode आपको \"सपोर्ट\" द्वारा पूरी तरह से सपोर्ट करेगा, मेरा मतलब है कि जब भी आप कुछ लिखेंगे तो यह ऑटो-कम्प्लीट हो जाएगा यदि आपने कोई विशेष टैग जीता है तो यह आपको mdn संदर्भ के लिए एक लिंक प्रदान करेगा ताकि यह आपके लिए चीजों को समझना और एक विशेष टैगो के संदर्भ में करना बहुत आसान हो जाएगा। टैग्स मैं आपको चैप्टर-2 में देखूंगा तो दोस्तों अब हम चैप्टर-2 पर हैं जिसमें हम कुछ बेसिक टैग्स के बारे में जानेंगे और हम कुछ वेबसाइट्स बनाने के लिए उन टैग्स का इस्तेमाल करेंगे इसलिए मैं जल्दी से चैप्टर-2 को खोलूंगा हां ऑप्टिमाइज़ेशन हो गया है जगह लेकिन अगर कोई ब्लॉग किसी पार से रिलेटेड है विशिष्ट व्यक्ति आपने कुछ ऐसी वेबसाइटें देखी होंगी जिनमें लोग html में एक बहुत ही मूल पृष्ठ बनाते हैं, आखिरकार वे वेबसाइटें \"प्रासंगिकता\" होने के कारण शीर्ष पर पॉप-अप होती हैं क्योंकि उन वेबसाइटों में वह सामग्री होती है जिसे उपयोगकर्ता वास्तव में खोजता है, मैं अधिक व्याख्या नहीं करूंगा SEO के बारे में मैंने केवल अध्याय -5 में SEO को शामिल किया है जो आपके लिए सीखने के लिए आवश्यक है यदि आप html सीख रहे हैं तो हम केवल html स्टैंड पॉइंट पर ध्यान केंद्रित करेंगे, हम seo की गहराई तक नहीं जाएँगे क्योंकि इसमें बहुत सारी चीज़ें शामिल हैं हम SEO के कंटेंट ऑप्टिमाइज़ेशन पहलू में कीवर्ड बिल्डिंग पर ध्यान नहीं देंगे, हम कीवर्ड बिल्डिंग कैसे करते हैं? इसलिए आपको SEO में बढ़ावा मिलेगा और आपका लोड समय भी कम हो जाएगा क्योंकि आप उस समय 100 mb की फ़ाइल लोड कर रहे थे और अब आप केवल 2 एमबी की फ़ाइल लोड कर रहे हैं, इसलिए निश्चित रूप से आपका लोड समय कम हो जाएगा, इसलिए छवि को संपीड़ित करने से आपका लोड समय कम हो जाता है और एचटीएमएल, सीएसएस और जेएस फ़ाइलों को कम करने और संपीड़ित करने का लाभ यह है कि आप अतिरिक्त फ़ाइलों को डाउनलोड नहीं कर रहे हैं और d इसके बाद \"इमेज में ऑल्ट टेक्स्ट जोड़ें\" मैंने आपको एक ऑल्ट एट्रिब्यूट के बारे में बताया है जिसमें अगर कोई इमेज लोड करने में विफल है तो एक टेक्स्ट प्रदर्शित होगा और यह एक अच्छा अभ्यास है क्योंकि यदि आपकी इमेज लोड होने में विफल रही तो आप एक ऑल्ट टेक्स्ट देखें और अगर यह आपकी वेबसाइट पर सामग्री पढ़ने के लिए आने वाले नेत्रहीन लोगों की भी मदद करता है, तो डिवाइस ऑल्ट टेक्स्ट को आपकी छवि के विषय की व्याख्या करने के लिए पढ़ते हैं, यहां देखें, इसे रेंडर किया गया है और जैसे ही मैं इस पेज को सेव करता हूं यह फिर से लोड होने के बाद स्वचालित रूप से परिवर्तन प्रदर्शित कर रहा है जिस तरह से यह html का काम नहीं है यह काम है अगर लाइव सर्वर लाइव सर्वर एक एक्सटेंशन है जो परिवर्तनों को दर्शाता है जब आप हर बार जब मैं अपनी वेबसाइट टेम्पलेट बनाता हूं तो आप अपनी फ़ाइलों को सहेजते हैं मैं हमेशा इसका उपयोग करता हूं लाइव सर्वर इस एक्सटेंशन को vscode में बहुत बनाया गया था अब हम समझ गए हैं \"एक टैग एक कंटेनर की तरह है\" आपका html दस्तावेज़ इससे ज्यादा कुछ नहीं है यह सिर्फ एक कोड का टुकड़ा है जो भी वेबसाइट आप अपने दैनिक आधार पर देखते हैं जैसे अगर आप देख रहे हैं मेरी वेबसाइट ए वास्तविक वेबसाइट यह एक नहीं है, लेकिन यह एक स्रोत कोड है, यह कोड के बारे में है और छवियों या लाल रंग के बटन के बारे में नहीं है या इसमें शामिल कुछ भी आपकी वेबसाइट इस कोड के रूप में ट्रांसपोर्ट करती है, वास्तव में यह कोड ट्रांसपोर्ट हो जाता है और फिर जैसा जैसे ही आपके ब्राउज़र को यह कोड मिलता है, वह इस कोड को इस रूप में प्रस्तुत करता है, इसलिए सर्वर के माध्यम से ब्राउज़र को कोड प्रदान किया जाता है और ब्राउज़र कोड को इस रूप में प्रस्तुत करता है, जिसे आप आमतौर पर देखते हैं, तो अब समझते हैं, जैसे ही आपके ब्राउज़र को यह html दस्तावेज़ मिलता है इसलिए आपका ब्राउज़र इस कोड को देखने योग्य रूप में परिवर्तित करने में एक प्रमुख भूमिका निभाता है, मैं कहूंगा कि एक अच्छी वेबसाइट है इसलिए हम इसके बारे में और जानने जा रहे हैं हम पेज लेआउट को परिभाषित करने के लिए बॉडी टैग के अंदर तत्व जोड़ सकते हैं मैं html तत्व के बारे में बात करूंगा html एलिमेंट से मेरा क्या मतलब है html एलिमेंट्स का मतलब है एक ओपनिंग टैग और एक क्लोजिंग टैग टैग खोना इसलिए मैंने इसे सामग्री के रूप में लिखा है, मैं इसे किसी भी शीर्षक के रूप में भी लिख सकता हूं, इसलिए आप चाहते हैं कि खोज इंजन आपकी वेबसाइट को समझें, इसलिए मैंने लिखा है \"इस तरह का पेज बनाना आवश्यक नहीं है\" लेकिन यह एक पठनीय और संरचित बनाता है लेआउट जैसे मैंने आपको दिखाया है और इस प्रकार के पेज भी एसईओ के अनुकूल हैं क्योंकि जब कंप्यूटर आपके पेज को देखने में सक्षम होता है, तो Google भी आपके पेज को इंडेक्स करना चाहता है यदि आप उल्लेख करते हैंमान लीजिए कि आप पूरे भारत के लिए एक पार्टी कर रहे हैं और आपने कहा कि जो भी आएगा मैं सबसे अच्छी पार्टी दूंगा लेकिन लोगों को कैसे पता चलेगा कि आप ऐसा हिस्सा प्रदान कर रहे हैं, आपको किसी भी तरह से जानकारी देनी होगी जैसे कि आपका पृष्ठ में कुछ बहुत ही स्पष्ट टैग होने चाहिए क्योंकि जब चीजें स्पष्ट होती हैं तो आप उन्हें ध्यान में रखते हैं कि यह व्यक्ति एक पार्टी फेंक रहा है यह बहुत स्पष्ट है या यदि आप इस तरह से अपने पृष्ठ की संरचना करते हैं लेकिन मैं केवल ऑन-पेज के बारे में बात करूंगा जो कि html द्वारा किया जा सकता है डेवलपर्स और ऑन-पेज एसईओ में आप एचटीएमएल एचटीएमएल के माध्यम से एसईओ कर सकते हैं डेवलपर निम्नलिखित तकनीकों का उपयोग करके एसईओ को कार्यान्वित कर सकते हैं हम कुछ तकनीकों के बारे में बात करेंगे और फिर से यह एसईओ का व्यापक अधिकार नहीं है जिसका अर्थ यह नहीं है कि यदि आप इसे सीखते हैं तो आपने पूरा कर लिया है seo मैं भविष्य में seo के लिए एक कोर्स बनाऊंगा लेकिन हम इसे 100% कॉपी करने में असमर्थ थे यहाँ देखो, यह अलग है और यह अलग है हम इसके कारण को भी समझेंगे और हम इसके कारण को संक्षेप में समझेंगे ई आगामी अध्याय लेकिन अभी के लिए याद रखें कि आपको कुछ भी डाउनलोड नहीं करना है, यहां से छवियां गायब हैं, स्टाइल शीट को डाउनलोड करने में कुछ समय लगा, यह काम कर रहा है, लेकिन कुछ छवियां गायब हैं लेकिन फिर से यदि आप एक ब्लॉग पर क्लिक करते हैं तो यह है काम नहीं कर रहा है इसलिए निष्कर्ष हैआप वेबसाइट को कॉपी कर सकते हैं लेकिन 100% नहीं, अब वेबसाइट को कॉपी करना इतना आसान नहीं है, अगर आपको समझ है तो आप कर सकते हैं, यह उतना मुश्किल नहीं है लेकिन यह इतना आसान नहीं है क्योंकिऔर मैं \"फिनिश\" पर क्लिक करूंगा और यदि आप हर कदम का पालन करते हैं और यदि आपने बनामकोड स्थापित किया है जैसा कि मैंने आपको बताया था और यदि आप यहां राइट क्लिक करते हैं तो आपको यहां एक विकल्प मिलेगा \"कोड के साथ खोलें\" हम इसे इस विकल्प को दिखाने के लिए कहते हैं जब हम vscode इंस्टॉल कर रहे थे तो \"ओपन विद कोड\" पर क्लिक करें और उसके बाद आपको इस डायरेक्टरी की सभी फाइलें यहां नहीं बल्कि यहां दिखाई देंगी और आप यहां क्लिक करके एक नई फाइल बना सकते हैं और यहां क्लिक करके एक नया फोल्डर बना सकते हैं यदि आप पहली बार vscode का उपयोग कर रहे हैं तो डरें नहीं क्योंकि क्लोजिंग टैग्स में इसे इस्तेमाल करने के बाद आपको इसकी आदत हो जाएगी इसलिए यह सोचेगा कि आपने \\'href\\' के बाद केवल इतना ही लिखा है इसलिए यह भ्रमित हो जाएगा और दे भी सकता है एक सिंटैक्स त्रुटि इसलिए यदि आप अपनी विशेषताओं की सामग्री में डबल कोट्स (\"\") का उपयोग कर रहे हैं तो बाहरी में सिंगल कोट्स (\\'\\') का उपयोग करना याद रखें और इसके विपरीत यदि आप सिंगल कोट्स (\\'\\') का उपयोग कर रहे हैं तो इसका उपयोग करें डबल कोट्स (\"\") या फिर आप सिंगल कोट्स (\\'\\') और डबल में से किसी का भी उपयोग कर सकते हैं उद्धरण (\"\") लेकिन अंत में, मैं आपको निरंतरता बनाए रखने की सलाह दूंगाऔर अगर मैं \"टैब\" कुंजी दबाता हूं और यहां लिखता हूं \"के बारे में जाना\" तो यह \"के बारे में\" पर जाने का प्रयास करेगाhtml\" मैं एक \"के बारे में बनाऊंगाhtml\" यहां मैं शीर्षक को \"के बारे में\" से बदल दूंगा और मैं एक पैराग्राफ लिखकर \"लोरेम 45\" लिखूंगा और फिर मैं \"सूचकांक\" से \"यह इस बारे में\" एक बहुत ही सरल बात लिखूंगाhtml\" जैसा कि मैं \"के बारे में जाना\" पर क्लिक करता हूं, तो देखो मुझे \"के बारे में\" पर रीडायरेक्ट किया गया हैhtml\" यह सापेक्ष लिंक है जो आपसे पूछ रहा है कि आपको \"href = https://codewithharrycom\" और फिर सामग्री लिखें \"हैरी की वेबसाइट पर जाने के लिए यहां क्लिक करें\" मान लीजिए कि आपने कुछ इस तरह लिखा है अब जब आप इसे देखेंगे तो आपको \"हैरी की वेबसाइट पर जाने के लिए यहां क्लिक करें\" पर एक लिंक मिलेगा और जब आप उस पर क्लिक करेंगे आपको \"codewithharrycom\" तो वास्तविक \\'href\\' में एंकर टैग के साथ \\'href\\' लिखा हुआ क्या है यह एक वेबसाइट का लिंक है और जब भी आप इस टेक्स्ट पर क्लिक करेंगे तो यह खुल जाएगा तो आपको क्या लगता है अगर आपने youtube जैसी वेबसाइट बनाई और किया एसईओ कोई मूल्य प्रदान किए बिना क्या आपको लगता है कि यूट्यूब की खोज करते समय आपकी वेबसाइट शीर्ष पर पॉप-अप होगी, निश्चित रूप से ऐसा नहीं है कि खोज इंजन अनुकूलन मौजूदा रैंकिंग में सुधार करने का एक तरीका है थोड़ा ध्यान दें मैं बल्कि एसईओ कहूंगा खोज इंजन को आपकी वेबसाइट खोजने में मदद करने का तरीका है, इसलिए अधिकतम आप Google को अपनी वेबसाइट के बारे में निर्दिष्ट कर सकते हैं और यह सामग्री है यदि आपने इंटरनेट पर एक उत्कृष्ट वेबसाइट बनाई है और फिर आपको लगता है कि आपकी वेबसाइट शीर्ष पर पॉप-अप होगी और आपने एक अच्छा कंटेंट भी लिखा है इसलिए google, bing और yahoo जैसे सर्च इंजन भी आपकी वेबसाइट, उसकी सामग्री और विवरण जैसे \"codewithharry\" के बारे में पूछते हैं।कॉम\" एक वेबसाइट है, यह वेबसाइट किसके बारे में है? इसलिए मुझे उम्मीद है कि आपको बात समझ में आ गई होगी और मेरे पेजों में एक त्रुटि थी कि पसंदीदा आइकन दिखाई नहीं दे रहा था, लेकिन उस त्रुटि को अब ठीक कर दिया गया है, इसलिए यदि आप इस तरह से पसंदीदा आइकन सेट करते हैं तो यह एक अच्छा उपयोगकर्ता अनुभव प्रदान करेगा और उपयोगकर्ता पाएगा कि वह एक वास्तविक वेबसाइट पर है जो अब अच्छा है अगला बिंदु \"छवियों और अन्य संसाधनों को संपीड़ित करें\" यदि आप छवि कंप्रेसर लिखते हैं तो आपको इंटरनेट पर कुछ छवि संपीड़न वेबसाइट मिल जाएगी जिसे आप अपनी छवि अपलोड कर सकते हैं और उन्हें संपीड़ित कर सकते हैं जिसका अर्थ है कि आप बहुत अधिक गुणवत्ता खोए बिना उनका आकार कम कर सकते हैं जब आप उन्हें संपीड़ित करते हैं तो आपकी छवि गुणवत्ता कम हो जाती है लेकिन कुछ संपीड़न हैं जो न्यूनतम गुणवत्ता को कम करके आपको बहुत अच्छा संपीड़न दे सकते हैं यह संभव है कि आपकी 25 एमबी की छवि 2 एमबी में बदल जाए और आपको गुणवत्ता में बहुत अधिक नुकसान न उठाना पड़े, अब मान लीजिए कि आप अपनी 100 एमबी की छवि को केवल इस छोटे से हिस्से में प्रदर्शित कर रहे हैं, तो इसका कोई मतलब नहीं है।html\\' एक्सटेंशन\" के साथ \"html\" हम भी उपयोग कर सकते हैं \"htm\" एक्सटेंशन अगर हम \"l\" में नहीं जोड़ते हैं \"html\" अगर हम आलसी हैं और हम पूरा \"html\" टाइप नहीं करना चाहते हैं, लेकिन हम केवल \"htm\" टाइप करना चाहते हैं, तो आपका स्वागत है, आप वह भी कर सकते हैं, आपके टेम्प्लेट काम करेंगे लेकिन मैं आपको कभी-कभी एक अस्वीकरण देना चाहता हूंमैं आपको दिखाता हूं कि लाइव सर्वर \"indexhtm\" यह पता लगाता है \"indexhtml\" एक प्रारंभिक पृष्ठ के रूप में लेकिन यदि आप \"indexhtm\" तो आपको यह पेज पूरी तरह से रेंडर हो जाएगा जिसका अर्थ है कि हमें ज्यादातर \"का उपयोग करना होगा\"html\" एक्सटेंशन है और हमें इसका उपयोग करने की आवश्यकता नहीं है \"एचटीएम\"\" यहtxt\" और आप यहाँ कुछ भी लिख सकते हैं यह इस फ़ाइल पर कुछ सामग्री है इसे सहेजें और इसके बाद आपको यहां अपने एक्सटेंशन टैब में क्लिक करना होगा और उसके बाद आपको एक एक्सटेंशन इंस्टॉल करना होगा जो \"लाइव सर्वर\" है अब आप में से कई लोग इसका उपयोग कर रहे हैं यह पहली बार है और आपको \"लाइव सर्वर\" के बारे में कोई जानकारी नहीं है, बस इस \"लाइव सर्वर\" को इंस्टॉल करें\"और यह अब स्थापित हो गया है जैसा कि आप देख सकते हैं कि\" लाइव सर्वर \"स्थापित किया गया है और मैं\" लाइव सर्वर \"के साथ कोई भी फाइल खोल सकता हूं, मैं आपको वह फाइल दिखाता हूं जिसे हमने बनाया था\" cwhhtml\" अगर मैं इस फ़ाइल पर राइट क्लिक करता हूं और \"लाइव सर्वर के साथ खुला\" पर क्लिक करता हूं तो मैं इस पर क्लिक करूंगा और यह मुझसे कुछ पूछ रहा है और मैं इसे रद्द कर दूंगा और इस लुक के बाद, यह मेरे लिए एक लाइव सर्वर बनाएगा जो इसे बनाता है एक वेबसाइट की तरह एक सर्वर और फिर उन सभी फाइलों को प्रदर्शित करें जिन्हें आप सीधे इन फाइलों पर डबल क्लिक करके खोल सकते हैं लेकिन इस विधि की सिफारिश की जाती है क्योंकि यह आपके लिए एक वेब सर्वर बनाता है और यदि आप वेब सर्वर का उपयोग कर रहे हैं तो वेब सर्वर का उपयोग करने का लाभ हैcss मैंने इसके बारे में अध्याय 0 में संक्षेप में चर्चा की है जहाँ मैंने इसे एक और सादृश्य के साथ समझाया है लेकिन अब हम बैकएंड और फ्रंटएंड के बीच के अंतर को समझेंगे और जब भी कोई वेब ब्राउज़र अनुरोध करता है तो एक बेसिक वेबसाइट कैसे काम करती है \"wwwcodewithharycom\" एक वेब सर्वर से तो बदले में वेब सर्वर आपके ब्राउज़र को html, css और js की फाइलें भेजता है, इन html, css और js फाइलों को पार्स करता है और आपको दिखाता है कि आप वास्तव में एक वेबसाइट में क्या देखते हैं, वास्तव में यह कोड था लेकिन आपका ब्राउज़र पार्स करता है इस तरह से कि एक सुंदर वेबसाइट आपको दिखाई दे रही है मैंने इस वीडियो को 5 अध्यायों में विभाजित किया है जहां मैंने प्रत्येक अध्याय के साथ एक अभ्यास सेट प्रदान किया है ताकि आप इसका अभ्यास कर सकें जो इसके बच्चे हैं अब मैं आपको vscode से एक बहुत ही दिलचस्प बात दिखाऊंगा अब यदि आप \"सिर\" के बाईं ओर क्लिक करते हैं, तो देखें कि वे ढह गए हैं और अब उन्होंने पतन-व्यय, पतन-व्यय का विस्तार किया है, इसलिए अब देखें कि html में सिर है और शरीर इसे इस तरह से समझता है कि html में 2 हैं बच्चे \"सिर\" और \"शरीर\" इसलिए जब html में 2 बच्चे \"सिर\" और \"शरीर\" हैं: तो html स्पष्ट रूप से \"सिर\" और \"शरीर\" का पिता है, यह साधारण आदमी है, कृपया यह न कहें कि आप इसे समझ नहीं पाए यह बहुत ही सरल बात है इसलिए html \"सिर\" और \"शरीर\" का जनक है और क्या है \"सिर\" और \"शरीर\" के बीच संबंध वे \"भाई-बहन\" हैं, यह सटीक शब्द है जिसका हम \"सिर\" और \"शरीर\" का उपयोग करते हैं, भाई बहन हैं अब यहां देखें मैंने यह लिखा है \"सिर और शरीर एचटीएमएल टैग के बच्चे टैग हैं \" उसी तरह \"h1\" और \"पैराग्राफ\" के बच्चे हैं? और बॉडी टैग html टैग के बच्चे हैं\" तो देखिए, आप अपना पूरा कोड इस तरह से देख सकते हैं कि पहले आपने अपना doc-type निर्दिष्ट किया है कि आपका doc-type html होगा, आपको पहला टैग इसकी तुलना में बहुत ही अनूठा लगेगा अन्य टैग और फिर हमारा मुख्य html पृष्ठ शुरू होता है हमने यहाँ html लिखा है और इसका समापन टैग कहाँ है? \"xu-a संगत\" का उपयोग Microsoft के पुराने ब्राउज़र संगतता के लिए किया जाता है और \"पोर्ट देखें\" का उपयोग प्रारंभिक पैमाने को बदलने के लिए किया जाता है इन 2 टैग्स के समान और भी टैग्स जिनका उपयोग हम अपनी वेबसाइट बनाने के लिए कर सकते हैं लेकिन सबसे पहले हम कुछ मॉस के बारे में जानेंगे html बॉडी में महत्वपूर्ण टैग में वे सभी टैग शामिल हैं जो आप इस वेब पेज पर देखेंगे जो टैग प्रदर्शित किए गए हैं वे बॉडी में मौजूद हैं अब यहां देखें, मैंने नोट्स में इसका उल्लेख किया है \"ब्राउज़र द्वारा प्रदान किए गए पृष्ठ का मुख्य भाग\" यह यहाँ दिखाई देने वाला टैग है और फिर मैंने एक पैराग्राफ टैग और एक हेडिंग टैग रिस्पॉन्सिव का अर्थ जोड़ा है यदि आप इस वेबसाइट का उपयोग किसी भी डिवाइस में करते हैं तो यह अच्छा दिखता है यदि आप सिर्फ फोन के लिए एक वेबसाइट बनाते हैं और यदि आप इसे खोल रहे हैं एक कंप्यूटर इसलिए यह समस्या पैदा कर रहा है उत्तरदायी इसका मतलब है कि आपकी वेबसाइट सभी उपकरणों के अनुकूल है इसलिए आजकल वेबसाइटों के लिए जवाबदेही जरूरी है यदि कोई क्लाइंट आपसे वेबसाइट बनाने के लिए कहता है तो वह आपको निर्दिष्ट नहीं करेगा 10 साल पहले जवाबदेही एक अतिरिक्त विशेषता थी जिसे इस रूप में गिना जाता था एक अच्छे प्रोग्रामर द्वारा एक अतिरिक्त सुविधा प्रदान की जाती है लेकिन आजकल यह एक आवश्यकता नहीं एक विकल्प है 10 साल पहले यह वैकल्पिक था आजकल कंप्यूटर की तुलना में फोन में इंटरनेट का अधिक उपयोग किया जाता है लेकिन यदि आप उस 10% में हैं जो समझ में नहीं आता है d आस्पेक्ट रेश्यो को गूगल करें, यह न सोचें कि आप मूर्ख हैं हर कोई किसी चीज में कमजोर है, उनके बारे में जल्द से जल्द ज्ञान प्राप्त करना बेहतर है, अब हम अगले एक पर आगे बढ़ेंगे जो मैंने यहां लिखा है यदि कोई पेज किसी डायरेक्टरी के अंदर है तो हम यह सुनिश्चित करने की आवश्यकता है कि हम जिस लिंक का उपयोग कर रहे हैं वह सही पृष्ठ के लिए है\" मेरा इससे क्या मतलब है? और यह href विशेषता और निरपेक्ष और सापेक्ष लिंक है अब हम \"छवि टैग\" के बारे में बात करेंगे छवि टैग बहुत सरल और सीधा है आगे वे आपके html पेज में छवियों को जोड़ने के लिए उपयोग किए जाते हैं, इसका मतलब है कि यदि आप अपने html पेज में छवियां जोड़ना चाहते हैं, तो आप img टैग का उपयोग कर सकते हैं, यह विशेषता है जो src है जो आपको बताती है कि आप कौन सी छवि जोड़ना चाहते हैं या पूर्ण करना चाहते हैं उदाहरण के लिए छवि का पतामैंने आपको अपने नोट्स में पहले ही बता दिया है कि टैग टैग की मदद से html में लाइन ब्रेक बनाने के लिए उपयोग किया जाता है जिसका अर्थ है कि यदि आप \"यह बोल्ड है\" \"यह इटैलिक है\" और \"यह अंडरलाइन है\" अलग-अलग लाइनों में है तो आपको इसका उपयोग करना चाहिए टैग एक खाली टैगिन केक है यदि आप इन सामग्रियों की तरह चॉकलेट या केक जोड़ना चाहते हैं तो आपको एचटीएमएल वेब पेज में एचटीएमएल टैग जोड़ना होगा जैसे आप खाना बनाते हैं, वैसे ही एक नुस्खा है जिसमें आप सामग्री जोड़ते हैं, यह ऐसा नहीं है जैसे आपने 10 चम्मच जोड़ा मिर्च पाउडर और 20 चम्मच नमक रेसिपी में एक सीक्वेंस है जिसे हमें फॉलो करना है जैसे कि html टैग्स का उपयोग करने का एक क्रम है आपको उन टैग्स को तदनुसार जोड़ना होगा अब देखो, html हाइपरटेक्स्ट मार्कअप लैंग्वेज के लिए खड़ा है html वेब की भाषा है वेबसाइट बनाने के लिए उपयोग किया जाता है हम इन टैग की समझ के साथ वेबसाइट के रूप और अनुभव को परिभाषित करने के लिए एचटीएमएल टैग का उपयोग करते हैं और उन्हें एक साथ कैसे रखा जाए, हम आसानी से सुंदर वेबसाइट बना सकते हैं हम इन टैग को समझने के साथ एक बहुत ही सुंदर वेबसाइट बना सकते हैं यदि हम जानते हैं कि कैसे हम आप कर सकते हैं इन टैग्स को एक साथ सेट करें ताकि हम बहुत सुंदर वेबसाइट बना सकें जैसे मैंने \"codewithharyकॉम\" मैंने निश्चित रूप से इसे बनाते समय अपने एचटीएमएल ज्ञान का उपयोग किया किसी भी प्रकार की वेबसाइट बनाते समय एचटीएमएल ज्ञान का उपयोग निश्चित रूप से किया जाएगा, लोगों के मन में सबसे बड़ा सवाल होगा \"अगर एचटीएमएल पर्याप्त है तो हमें सीएसएस और जेएस की आवश्यकता क्यों है? \"मान लीजिए अगर आप उन विकल्पों की जांच करना भूल जाते हैं तो आप इसे फिर से चलाते हैं जैसे मेरी तरह आपको कोई नुकसान नहीं होगा आप कोई महत्वपूर्ण फाइल नहीं खोएंगे मैं इसे लॉन्च नहीं करूंगा क्योंकि शीर्षक मुख्य चीज है जो आपके आने पर सर्च में दिखाई जाती है एक अच्छे शीर्षक पर इसलिए उच्च संभावना है कि आप उस पर क्लिक करेंगे क्योंकि वेबसाइट पर क्लिक करने के लिए बहुत ही कदम है और यदि आप वेबसाइट और अपनी वेबसाइट पर क्लिक नहीं करते हैं तो आप केवल तभी सामग्री पढ़ेंगे जब आप इसे उपयोगी पाएंगे सीटीआर नहीं है (क्लिक थ्रू रेट) अब जैसे ही मैंने यह टैग खोला अब मुझे इस टैग को भी बंद करना है हमें लगभग सभी html टैग खोलने हैं और हमें उन्हें भी बंद करना है कुछ टैग ऐसे हैं जिन्हें बंद करने की आवश्यकता नहीं है , और उन टैग को खाली टैग कहा जाता है, लेकिन अधिकांश टैग जो हम पृष्ठ में उपयोग करते हैं और जिसमें सामग्री होती है, हमें उस प्रकार के टैग को बंद करना होता है, मैंने \"हेड\" टैग और फिर \"शीर्षक\" टैग जोड़ा है, जब भी आप बना रहे हैं एक गंभीर वेबसाइट यह वेबसाइट गंभीर नहीं है मैं जू हूं पहला यह आपको सिखाने के लिए बना रहा है कि क्या आप कॉलेज फेस्ट के लिए एक वेब-पेज बना रहे हैं या अपने सहपाठियों या अपनी कंपनी के समूह के बारे में जानकारी एकत्र करने के लिए यदि आप इस तरह की चीजें कर रहे हैं तो यह एक गंभीर वेबसाइट नहीं है लेकिन अगर आप एक शुरू कर रहे हैं ब्लॉग और आप उससे अपनी जीविका उत्पन्न करना चाहते हैं तो यह एक गंभीर व्यवसाय है, इसलिए देखिए मैंने अभी हेडर में कुछ भी नहीं जोड़ा है, मैं \"यह हेडर है\" लिखूंगा और फुटर में मैं लिखूंगा \"यह फुटर है\" मैं इसे सहेज लूंगा और इसे लाइव सर्वर के साथ खोलें और मेरी वेबसाइट लाइव सर्वर में खुलेगी और जैसा कि आप देख सकते हैं \"यह हेडर\" \"यह मुख्य सामग्री है\" और उन्होंने इसे अपने मेटा टैग में जोड़ा होगा अब देखो, अगर मैं इस वेबसाइट को खोलता हूं तो उच्च है संभावना है कि उन्होंने मेटा विवरण जोड़ा होगा और आप देख सकते हैं कि उन्होंने विवरण के लिए मेटा टैग जोड़ा है, हमारे पास कई प्रकार के मेटा टैग हैं, लेकिन आपको विवरण के लिए मेटा टैग सेट करना होगा, यहां आपकी सामग्री प्रदर्शित होने की कोई गारंटी नहीं है। Google आपके मेटा विवरण का उपयोग करेगा केवल तभी जब यह उपयोग करने योग्य होगा, मैं आपको अपने अनुभव के साथ बता रहा हूं, मैंने इसे उन सभी वेबसाइटों से देखा है जिन्हें मैंने अभी बनाया और Google पर दिखाई दिया \"एक अच्छा यूआरएल स्लग सेट करें\" इसका क्या अर्थ है? समीकरण अब सही ढंग से प्रदर्शित होता है (c + o₂ ➜ co₂ )\"पृष्ठभूमि: लाल\" और फिर मैं इसे इस तरह से बंद कर दूंगा और जब मैं इसे छोटा कर दूंगा तो देखो यह सभी रिक्त स्थान और नई लाइनों को हटा देता है यदि बड़ी सीएसएस फ़ाइलों में बहुत सारे स्थान होते हैं तो आकार उस फ़ाइल की संख्या बढ़ जाएगी और यह वेबसाइट उन सभी को हटा देती है और जब हम इस प्रारूप में html या css कोड लिखते हैं तो हम अधिक स्थान और नई पंक्तियाँ जोड़ते हैं क्योंकि हमें पठनीयता बढ़ानी होती है हम पठनीयता बढ़ाने के लिए प्रारूप दस्तावेज़ करते हैं ताकि जब हम या हमारे साथी प्रोग्रामर इस कोड को पढ़ते हैं या इस कोड को बेहतर बनाने की कोशिश करते हैं ताकि उन्हें इस कोड को पढ़ने और बकवास करने में कठिनाई न हो इसलिए हम इस प्रकार की चीजों से बचना चाहते हैं लेकिन जब कंप्यूटर इस फाइल को पढ़ता है तो आप एक कंप्रेस्ड फाइल दे सकते हैं जिसका मतलब है कि आप इन नई लाइनों और अतिरिक्त स्पा को हटा सकते हैं cesif एक एंकर टैग है और आप href विशेषता निर्दिष्ट कर रहे हैं और इसे लिख रहे हैं इसमें मूल्य है इसलिए पहले विशेषता का नाम और फिर \"=\" के बाद डबल कोट्स (\"\") या सिंगल कोट्स (\\'\\') में विशेषता का मान और फिर आप हमेशा की तरह टैग लिख सकते हैं अब मैंने यहां लिखा है हम या तो विशेषता में सिंगल कोट्स (\\'\\') या डबल कोट्स (\"\") का उपयोग करते हैं और अब हेडिंग टैग आता है जब भी आप अपनी वेबसाइट या कोई भी बनाते हैं तो हेडिंग टैग पर चर्चा करते हैं यदि आप अपनी वेबसाइट के पेज को एक हेडिंग देना चाहते हैं तो आप इसे एक हेडिंग हेडिंग टैग देना चाहेंगे जिसका उपयोग एचटीएमएल में हेडिंग को चिह्नित करने के लिए किया जाता है यदि आप किसी टेक्स्ट को हेडिंग बनाना चाहते हैं तो इसे खोलें और मैं आपको \"नया टेक्स्ट डॉक्यूमेंट\" लिखने के बाद एक नया टेक्स्ट डॉक्यूमेंट प्रदान करूंगा। लिखेंगे\"नोटपैडhtml\" मैं एक काम करूंगा, अभी के लिए मैं इसे \"नोटपैड\" में बदल दूंगाtxt\" और मैं आईटीआई में कुछ html कोड जोड़ूंगा, मैंने आपको बताया है कि इसका उपयोग पैराग्राफ जोड़ने के लिए किया जाता है और आप पैराग्राफ कैसे जोड़ सकते हैं और यदि आप पैराग्राफ बदलना चाहते हैं तो आप इसे इस तरह बदल सकते हैं जब मैं \"lorem34\" लिखूंगा तो 34 शब्द इस तरह दिखाई देंगे जैसे एक क्षैतिज स्क्रॉल बार यहां दिखाई दिया है और यदि आप इस क्षैतिज स्क्रॉल बार के बजाय इस तरह का दृश्य चाहते हैं तो मैं आपको दिखाता हूं कि मैं अब किस बारे में बात कर रहा हूं अगर हम \"टॉगल वर्ड रैप\" पर क्लिक करते हैं तो यह स्क्रॉल बार गायब हो जाएगा और लाइन नंदिखाई देगा जिसका अर्थ है कि वास्तव में यह लाइन #17 नहीं है, लेकिन केवल यह सामग्री लाइन #17 है, लेकिन यह आपको कई लाइनों में प्रदर्शित कर रही है, इसलिए आपको इसे क्षैतिज रूप से स्क्रॉल करने की आवश्यकता नहीं है, इसे वर्ड रैप कहा जाता है और हम वर्ड रैप देख सकते हैं बहुत सी विचारधाराओं में कार्यक्षमता पैराग्राफ है, लेकिन मैं अपने विल iv \\'टैग द विल iv\\' टैग पर जाऊंगा, मुख्य टैग के अंदर था, मैंने यह जोड़ा है कि अनुभाग में देखें कि यह कितना iv होगा \\'स्थान पर कब्जा करना चाहिए? यह समीकरण है कार्बन ऑक्सीडाइजेशन के बारे में हम इसे लिखेंगे चलिए मैं आपको बताता हूं कि आप इसे पैराग्राफ में कैसे लिख सकते हैं आप इसे लिख सकते हैं (c+o2 ➜ co2) iv\\' अन्य तत्वों की तरह जहां भी वे कदम रखते हैं-पूरा स्थान उनका है और स्पैन\\' एक मासूम लड़के की तरह है, यह केवल उस पर ध्यान केंद्रित करता है, यह जॉब और स्पैन है\\' केवल उस स्थान पर कब्जा कर लेता है जिसकी उसे आवश्यकता है, मैं यहां से पैराग्राफ हटा दूंगा क्योंकि यह एक ब्लॉक एलिमेंट है और मैं केवल स्पैन रखूंगा \\'पैराग्राफ एक ब्ल है ock एलिमेंट एंड स्पैन\\' एक इन-लाइन एलिमेंट है अगर मैं \"indexhtml\" मेरे url बार में तब भी मुझे वही पेज मिलेगा \"यह एक शीर्षक है, यह एक पैराग्राफ है\" अगर मेरे पेज का नाम \"इंडेक्स\" नहीं थाhtml\" मान लीजिए कि अगर मैं इस फ़ाइल का नाम बदलता हूं तो मान लीजिए कि अगर मैं इसे \"एफ 2\" दबाकर इसका नाम बदलता हूं और अगर मैं इसे \"यह\" देता हूं तो मैं इसे कोई यादृच्छिक नाम देता हूंhtml\" के बजाय \"indexhtml\" आप इसे किसी के नाम के नाम पर रख सकते हैं, मैं इसका नाम \"हैरीhtml\" नाम बदलने के बाद क्या मैं कुछ भी देख पाऊंगा? मुझसे संपर्क करें\" तो आप यहां होंगे और यदि आप \"/देखना शुरू करें\" पर क्लिक करते हैं, तो जब आप \"/वीडियो/जावा ट्यूटोरियल फॉर बिगिनर्स\" पर जाते हैं तो आप यहां होंगे, इसलिए आप इस पृष्ठ पर समाप्त होते हैं, इसलिए उन्होंने पूर्ण का मिश्रण जोड़ा है & विकिपीडिया के स्रोत में सापेक्ष लिंक और विकिपीडिया का आपका संस्करण सापेक्ष लिंक खोजने में असमर्थ हैजो \"विकिपीडिया\" से संबंधित हैंorg\" लेकिन यह \"12700:5500\" मैं आपको यह दिखाता हूं और मुझे उम्मीद है कि आपने vscode इंस्टॉल कर लिया है, हम अपनी पसंद के किसी भी टेक्स्ट एडिटर का उपयोग कर सकते हैं, एक बार फिर मैं आपको बता दूं कि मैं vscode का उपयोग कर रहा हूं क्योंकि यह Microsoft से हल्का ओपन-सोर्स है, आपको बस इतना करना है Google पर जाएं और \"vscode\" खोजें, बस इसे मेरी तरह इंस्टॉल करें आप नोटपैड में भी html लिख सकते हैं पाठ-संपादक जैसे vscode बस इन चीजों को आसान बनाएं हम देखेंगे कि कैसे vscode इन चीजों को आसान बनाता है मैं इसे \"cwh बनाऊंगा\"html\" फ़ाइल, एक खाली फ़ाइल मैं आपको दिखाता हूँ कि कैसे vscode एक महान वी-विकास में सुविधा प्रदान करता है यदि आप एक \"विस्मयादिबोधक चिह्न\" (!) कुछ बुनियादी टैग यहाँ हम पेज लेआउट को परिभाषित करने के लिए बॉडी टैग के अंदर तत्व जोड़ सकते हैं हमने सीखा है कि हमारे पास बॉडी टैग हैं जो शरीर द्वारा प्रदान किए जाते हैं और हम उस बॉडी टैग में कुछ टैग जोड़ सकते हैं जो हमें दिखाई देंगे ब्राउज़र हमने h1 टैग के बारे में सीखा है \"यह एक शीर्षक है\" और इसके बाद मैं एक पैराग्राफ लिखूंगा \"यह एक पैराग्राफ है\" और अब इस शीर्षक और पैराग्राफ के लिए छोड़ दें क्योंकि हम सिर्फ एक html पेज बनाना चाहते हैं और हम चाहते हैं इसे \"लाइव सर्वर\" में खोलने के लिए क्योंकि हम देखना चाहते हैं कि हमारा पेज हमारे सर्वर लुक में कैसा दिखेगा, जैसा कि मैंने इसे \"लाइव सर्वर\" में खोला है, इसलिए url में क्या लिखा है \"127001:5500\" जो \"लाइव सर्वर\" एक्सटेंशन द्वारा बनाया गया सर्वर है, इस सर्वर को बनाने के बाद यह \"इंडेक्स\" प्रदर्शित कर रहा हैhtml\" पृष्ठ इस सर्वर के माध्यम से लेकिनमुझे ध्यान से सुनो अगर मैं यह नहीं लिखता \"indexhtml\" तो क्या होगा? बड़ी हेडिंग के लिए h1 और छोटी हेडिंग के लिए h6 हमें ऐसा नहीं करना है और हमें हेडिंग को सावधानी से इस्तेमाल करना है हमें पैराग्राफ टैग के साथ पैराग्राफ लिखना है और हमें हेडिंग को साथ में लिखना है हेडिंग टैग हमें उन्हें ध्यान से उपयोग करना है अब देखिए, मैंने आपको पैराग्राफ, एंकर और उन सभी के बारे में बताया है जो अब नोट्स पर वापस जाते हैं मैंने यहां कुछ लिखा है जो मैंने अभी आपको बताया है नोट: - आइए मैं आपको एक वसीयत दिखाता हूं iv\\' और फिर मैं आपको एक स्पैन दिखाऊंगा \\'क्या iv\\' एक कंटेनर है और स्पैन\\' भी एक कंटेनर है मैं लिखूंगा \"मैं यहां एक स्पैन टैग हूं\" यहां हम \"कौन सी सामग्री खोजी जा रही है\" के अनुसार सामग्री अनुकूलन लेखन सामग्री करते हैं कितने समय के लिए\" यह भी seo के अंतर्गत आता है लेकिनहम उस पहलू पर ध्यान केंद्रित नहीं करेंगे हम मौजूदा की तलाश करेंगे जो पहले से ही लिखा है कि उस पृष्ठ में एसईओ कैसे जोड़ना है हम अधिक एचटीएमएल टैग और अनुकूलन जोड़कर उस वेबसाइट की रैंकिंग में सुधार कैसे कर सकते हैं और किसी भी अवैध तरीके से हम वास्तव में प्रदान नहीं करेंगे हमारे उपयोगकर्ताओं के लिए मूल्य और हम यह कैसे करेंगे? मान लें कि यदि आप तृतीय पक्ष जावास्क्रिप्ट लाइब्रेरी स्थापित करते हैं या यदि आप तृतीय-पक्ष सीएसएस फ्रेम वर्क का उपयोग करते हैं तो संभव है कि उन्होंने हेडर या फुटर जैसे कुछ विशेष टैग को लक्षित किया हो और आप उपयोग नहीं कर रहे हों वह लेआउट इसलिए हो सकता है कि आपको उस लाइब्रेरी का उपयोग करते समय समस्याओं का सामना करना पड़े, इसलिए मैं बेहतर उपयोगकर्ता अनुभव का सुझाव दे रहा हूं, इसलिए अब हम सीखेंगे कि वेबसाइट का लेआउट कैसे बनाया जाए, आदर्श रूप से आपकी वेबसाइट में एक हेडर होगा और फिर एक मुख्य टैग और एक फुटर होगा। कि css और js के माध्यम से अब हम केवल html सीख रहे हैं, इसलिए हम पहले इस html चरण को समाप्त करेंगे और फिर हम उस जवाबदेही की ओर बढ़ेंगे जिसका उपयोग आप \"तत्वों का निरीक्षण\" और \"पृष्ठ स्रोत देखें\" और html ele का उपयोग कर सकते हैं ments = स्टार्ट टैग + कंटेंट + एंड टैग आपको इन चीजों को सीखने की जरूरत नहीं है, मैं आपको सिर्फ सीएसएस स्टाइल शीट को हटाने के बाद दिखा रहा हूं और सीएसएस स्टाइल शीट को हटाने के बाद देख रहा हूं, यह ऐसा दिखता है अब आपको स्टाइल को हटाने का तरीका सीखने की जरूरत नहीं है शीट्स क्योंकि मैं आपको यह सिखाने जा रहा हूं कि आपको निरंतरता बनाए रखनी है यदि आप सिंगल कोट्स (\\'\\') का उपयोग कर रहे हैं तो उनका उपयोग करते रहें और यदि आप डबल कोट्स (\"\") का उपयोग कर रहे हैं तो उनका उपयोग करते रहें इसलिए मैं इन्हें हटा दूंगा डबल कोट्स (\"\") यहां से क्योंकि यहां वेबसाइट का url यह है और इसमें डबल कोट्स (\"\") शामिल नहीं हैं, मैं इसमें एक उप शीर्षक जोड़ने जा रहा हूं औरमुख्य कारण मान लीजिए कि हम मुख्य कारण और पैराग्राफ लिख रहे हैं और मान लीजिए कि हमने मुख्य कारणों में 45 शब्द लिखे हैं तो जब मैं लाइव सर्वर में अपना पेज खोलूंगा तो यह ऐसा दिखेगा जैसे एक पेज हेडिंग है हाँ यह ठीक है मैंने इसे जानबूझकर बदल दिया है अब मैं इसे नोटपैड के साथ खोलूंगा मैं इसे सरल नोटपैड खोलूंगा जो हर कंप्यूटर में होता है यदि आप मैक या लिनक्स का उपयोग कर रहे हैं तो एक मूल संपादक निश्चित रूप से प्रत्येक ऑपरेटिंग सिस्टम के साथ भेज दिया जाता है तो चलिए यहां और हम क्या करते हैं करेंगे? तो मुझे आशा है कि आप समझ गए होंगे कि पूर्ण और सापेक्ष यूआरएल कैसे लिखना है अब हम नोट्स पर वापस जाएंगे और हम \"बोल्ड, इटैलिक और अंडरलाइन टैग\" के बारे में बात करेंगे हम \"बोल्ड, इटैलिक और अंडरलाइन टैग\" का उपयोग कर सकते हैं। हमारे ग्रंथों को उजागर करने के लिए तो मैं आपको \"बोल्ड, इटैलिक और अंडरलाइन टैग\" का एक डेमो देता हूं, इसलिए मैं \"बोल्ड, इटैलिक और अंडरलाइन टैग\" लिखूंगा, इसलिए देखिए मुझे \"कोडविथरी\" पर रीडायरेक्ट कर दिया गया हैकॉम\" तो इससे कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता कि कोई छवि या टेक्स्ट है जिसे आप एक नए टैब में वेबसाइट पर रीडायरेक्ट कर देंगे, मुझे आशा है कि यह अब आसान था अगर मैं यहां ऊंचाई भी जोड़ता हूं तो मैं आपको नोट पर ले जाता हूं मैंने कुछ लिखा है \" यदि पृष्ठ निर्देशिका के अंदर है तो हमें यह सुनिश्चित करने की आवश्यकता है कि हम सही पृष्ठ से लिंक करते हैं \"मान लीजिए कि आप\" मानव छवि \"दिखाना चाहते हैं, मुझे पता है कि यह बहुत अजीब है लेकिन\" alt \"का अर्थ है वह पाठ जो छवि के दौरान दिखाया जाना चाहिए अगर मैं इसे \"unsplash4कॉम\" तो यह छवि लोड नहीं हो सकती है और मैं \"मानव छवि\" देख पाऊंगा जिसका अर्थ है \"ऑल्ट\" और अब अगर मैं यूआरएल को ठीक करता हूं जिसे मैंने गड़बड़ कर दिया है तो मैं इसे सहेज लूंगा तो मैं नहीं देख पाऊंगा \"Alt\" जिसका अर्थ है \"alt\" में पाठ केवल तभी दिखाया जाएगा जब छवि लोड करने में असमर्थ हो \"ऑडियो चला रहा है\" \"मुख्य टैग\" \"सिमेंटिक टैग\" \"एसईओ\" ऐसी बहुत सी चीजें हैं जो लोग आमतौर पर याद करते हैं मैं इस वीडियो में इन सभी विषयों को शामिल करने जा रहा हूं और मैं आपको एक सफल + लाभदायक एचटीएमएल डेवलपर बनाऊंगा ताकि आप एक अच्छा स्टार्टर प्राप्त कर सकें और आप अच्छी वेबसाइट बना सकें अब मैं आपको एचटीएमएल, सीएसएस और जेएस के बीच अंतर बताना चाहता हूं एक सादृश्य html एक मानव कंकाल की तरह है और css कंकाल पर त्वचा की तरह है, इसका मतलब यह सुशोभित करता है कि css html पर वही काम करता है जैसे त्वचा हमारे कंकाल पर करती है हमारी त्वचा हमारे कंकाल को अच्छा दिखने में मदद करती है और css मदद करती है सुंदर दिखने के लिए html जैसे हमारा दिमाग हमें लॉजिक देता है ठीक उसी तरह js बनी हुई वेबसाइट को लॉजिक देता है htmli मतलब तर्क के साथ कब ब्रेक लगाना है और कितने दबाव में गियर कैसे बदलना है गियर बदलने के बाद क्या होगा इसे जावास्क्रिप्ट के उदाहरण के रूप में लें जब उपयोगकर्ता गियर बदलेगा तो क्या होगा अब मान लीजिए कि एक कार है जो दिखती है अच्छा है लेकिन इसका ब्रेक काम नहीं करता है और इसका इंजन भी टूटा हुआ है जिससे कार भी बेकार है इसलिए यह एक वेबसाइट पर html, css और js की भूमिका है, html एक वेबसाइट का फ्रेम है css सजावट है और जावास्क्रिप्ट फ्रंटएंड है तर्क मैं इसे फ्रंटएंड लॉजिक के रूप में क्यों संदर्भित कर रहा हूं, इसलिए जावास्क्रिप्ट क्लाइंट साइड लॉजिक का एक प्रकार है, जिसका अर्थ है कि वह तर्क जो उपयोगकर्ता भी देख सकता है और बैकएंड लॉजिक हमेशा हमसे छिपा रहता है, जहां से यह वेबसाइट आ रही है, उदाहरण के लिए मेरी वेबसाइट डिजाइन की गई थी django तो djangos बैकएंड किस तर्क का उपयोग कर रहा है मैं कभी नहीं जान पाऊंगा मैं केवल दृश्यपटल के तर्क को देख सकता हूं मैं देख सकता हूं कि यह तर्क है कि यह कैसे काम कर रहा है = \"cwhjfif\" और कुल मिलाकर मैं \"हैरीज़ वेबसाइट\" लिखूंगा, इसलिए मैं इसे काट दूंगा और मैं इसे सहेज लूंगा और मुझे चौड़ाई विशेषता \"चौड़ाई = 123\" जोड़ने दूंगा और छवि में चौड़ाई और ऊंचाई दोनों विशेषताएं हैं, हम जल्द ही इस बारे में बात करेंगे लेकिन बिंदु मैं यहां हाइलाइट करना चाहता हूं, मुझे यह दिखाने दें कि पहले आप \"https: //\" कमांड कर रहे हैं, जिसका अर्थ है कि इंटरनेट पर एक वेबसाइट है \"कोडविथरी\" उस पर रीडायरेक्ट करता है, इसलिए ये दोनों अलग हैं, इसमें अंतर यह है कि आप किसी भी कंप्यूटर से विश्व स्तर पर जा सकते हैं लेकिन इसमें आप केवल तभी जा सकते हैं जब आप एक ही सर्वर में हों, जिसका अर्थ है कि आपको केवल सापेक्ष लिंक का उपयोग करना है जब आप अपने सर्वर में हैं वास्तव में मैं लाइव सर्वर + /\" का उपयोग कर रहा हूं टिप्पणी करने और टिप्पणी करने के लिए टिप्पणी का अर्थ है किसी भी पाठ पर टिप्पणी करने का अर्थ है असम्बद्धता का अर्थ है कोई भी पाठ जिस पर पहले ही टिप्पणी की जा चुकी है-टिप्पणी रहितऔर प्रोग्रामिंग करते समय हम इस शब्दावली का भरपूर उपयोग करेंगे \"पैराग्राफ के नीचे सुधार करें\" और \"भविष्य में यह शीर्षक बदल जाएगा\" मैं इन सभी को छोड़ दूंगा और अगला बिंदु \"केस सेंसिटिविटी\" पढ़ूंगा html एक केस सेंसिटिव है भाषा: हिन्दी? और इस तरह आप टैग लिख सकते हैं और जहां भी आप टैग जोड़ेंगे एक नई लाइन जोड़ी जाएगी मैं \"यह बोल्ड है\" और \"यह इटैलिक है\" के बाद एक नई लाइन की उम्मीद करेगा एंकर टैग का उपयोग किसी मौजूदा सामग्री के लिंक जोड़ने के लिए किया जाता है एक html पृष्ठ जिसका अर्थ है कि यदि आप html पृष्ठ में लिंक जोड़ना चाहते हैं तो इसका अर्थ है कि यदि आप उपयोगकर्ता को साइट के भीतर किसी भिन्न पृष्ठ पर पुनर्निर्देशित करना चाहते हैं या आप उपयोगकर्ता को विश्व स्तर पर किसी भिन्न वेबसाइट पर पुनर्निर्देशित करना चाहते हैं तो आप केवल एंकर टैग कर सकते हैं जैसे मैंने यहाँ \"codewithharryकॉम\" इसलिए अगर कोई इस पर क्लिक करता है तो अगर मैं \"href = /about लिखता हूं तो उन्हें हैरी की वेबसाइट पर रीडायरेक्ट किया जाएगाhtml \"हाँ निश्चित रूप से मैं सक्षम था और जब आप सीएसएस सीखेंगे तो आपको पता चल जाएगा कि इस प्रश्न को हल करने के लिए आपके पास कितने विकल्प हैं और जब आप सीएसएस सीखेंगे तो आप पाएंगे कि आप किसी भी तत्व का आकार बदल सकते हैं और जब आप कर सकते हैं ऐसा करें कि कभी-कभी आप फॉन्ट बदलने जैसे आसान टैग का उपयोग करने के लिए बहुत लालची हो जाते हैं और पैराग्राफी ने इसे गलती से बंद कर दिया है, यह अच्छा है कि मैं इसे सहेजने में कामयाब रहा, मैंने इसे सहेजा है और देखें कि यह पृष्ठ कैसे प्रस्तुत कर रहा है h1 इस तरह दिखेगा और हो सकता है यह भी h1 है, मैंने h1 को दो बार लिखा है, अगर मैं गलत नहीं हूँ, आशा है कि आप html को समझ गए होंगे और भविष्य में मैं नोट्स के साथ css के लिए एक कोर्स अपलोड करूँगा और कृपया टिप्पणियों में बताएं कि क्या आप वह भी चाहते हैं और उसमें हम सीखेंगे कि वेबसाइट कैसे बनाते हैं हम अच्छी वेबसाइट टेम्पलेट बनाना सीखेंगे और cssh1 के बीच में सामग्री के साथ उद्घाटन और समापन टैग हैं ठीक उसी तरह जैसे \"पैराग्राफ\" में सामग्री के साथ उद्घाटन और समापन टैग होते हैं जिसके बीच में हम अधिकांश html को समझ चुके हैं तत्वों बीच में सामग्री के साथ उद्घाटन और समापन टैग हैं हमने इस पर चर्चा की है \"कुछ एचटीएमएल टैग में कोई सामग्री नहीं है\" कुछ एचटीएमएल टैग हैं जिनमें उदाहरण के लिए कोई सामग्री नहीं हैजैसा कि मैंने इसका इस्तेमाल किया है \"सीडब्ल्यूएचjfif\" मान लीजिए कि यह \"img\" नाम वाले फ़ोल्डर के अंदर है, मान लीजिए कि मैंने अपनी सभी छवियों को आईएमजी फ़ोल्डर में स्थानांतरित कर दिया है, आइए हम कहें कि मैं इस विशेष वेबसाइट में 100 छवियों का उपयोग कर रहा हूं और मुझे अपनी निर्देशिका में यहां छवियों का बंडल नहीं चाहिए'"
